This formative qualitative study explored the perceptions of tobacco users and healthcare providers (HCPs) regarding developing a mHealth intervention for SLT cessation. Methods: This was a qualitative study using in-depth interviews (IDIs) with tobacco users (n = 26) and primary care physicians (PCPs) (n = 5) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with counsellors (n = 2) in four urban primary health centres (UPHCs) in Berhampur, Odisha from February to March 2020. The data were coded and analysed by two researchers using a framework analysis method. The discussion guides and initial codes were developed based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behaviour change. Results: The results were elaborated under four themes: (1) Current scenario of SLT use; (2) Barriers and facilitators for quitting SLT; (3) Barriers and facilitators for mHealth counselling; and (4) Design and delivery of the proposed intervention. SLT use was prevalent in the community regardless of sociodemographic factors. Peer factors accounted for both tobacco consumption as well as considering cessation. Participants considered mobile message counselling helpful and acceptable. Not having a mobile phone and illiteracy were identified as barriers while ease of access and rising popularity of social media applications were considered facilitators to the use of mHealth for quitting tobacco. Participants preferred messages that were pictorial, short and simple, in the local language, and tailored to individual's needs. Conclusions: This is the first study that provides evidence within the Indian context that the text messaging platform may be used for delivering an SLT cessation intervention. The integration of a theoretical basis and research findings from target users can guide future intervention development. © The Author(s) 2023.","India; intervention; mobile health; primary care; Qualitative research; smokeless tobacco","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146288354"

With the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) consolidated to bring this epidemic to an end by 2025, the rapidly growing mobile health technologies can be utilized to offer promising results. Even though the implementation of this novel strategy is escalating around the globe, its triumph is still sub optimal in India. Objectives: This scoping review intends to explore the available mobile health (mHealth) technologies and analyse the effectiveness of the same for tuberculosis management in India. Methods: An elaborate search in electronic databases, such as PubMed and Google scholar, using the key terms and focussing from the year 2015, provided very broad results focussing on mHealth interventions and their utilisation in TB management in India. Further selection of the inclusive publications was carried out based upon the eligibility requirements as formulated for this review, pertaining to the objective of this study. Results: The collaborate search yielded a total of 858 scientific research papers. After the filtering of the obtained results, a total of 45 articles were selected to be analysed for this review. Published manuscripts, articles in peer review and abstracts from reliable databases were included to obtain vast range of information. Conclusion: The extensive literature search showed a preponderance of mHealth intervention studies focusing on TB treatment and drug monitoring. There exists a paucity of mHealth applications targeted to educate the public and intercept this infectious disease. The scientific articles reviewed and analysed in this scoping review strongly recommend the demployment of mHealth applications to achieve the target of eradicating TB by 2025 in India. © 2022 by the authors.","chatbots; diagnosis; eHealth; electronic applications; follow up; mHealth; mHealth interventions; mobile apps; prevention; SMS based; software applications; TB management; tuberculosis in India","alpha fetoprotein; CA 19-9 antigen; carcinoembryonic antigen; desmin (protein); keratin; metadrenalin; monoclonal antibody HMB 45; transcription factor PAX8; vimentin; adrenal cancer; aged; artificial ventilation; blood pressure; carcinosarcoma; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; endocrine disease; excision; female; histology; histopathology; human; hypertension; immunohistochemistry; leukocyte count; outcome assessment; physical examination; psoas muscle; Review","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140588422"

Research evaluating the feasibility of mHealth to address OUD is limited in developing countries. We aimed to assess the digital capacity and interest in mHealth interventions in patients maintained on opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Methods: 150 patients on OAT from a community drug treatment clinic in New Delhi, India, were included. We assessed the participants on their pattern of mobile and Internet use and their willingness to use mHealth technology to access health information and services related to OUD. Results: 88% of participants (n = 132) owned a mobile phone at assessment; 2.7% (n = 4) had never used a mobile phone in their lifetime. 70% (n = 105) participants had Internet access. 80% (n = 120) of participants showed interest in receiving text messages related to the management of OUD. 60% of participants showed a willingness to download and use applications for monitoring their substance use. Conclusions: In India, there is an interest among people on OAT to use mHealth interventions to manage their substance use. This population also has access to mobile phones and the necessary knowledge to install and run applications needed for various mHealth interventions. © 2022 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.","mHealth; mobile technology; opioid agonist treatment; opioid use disorder","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111694485"

With sensors introduced in smart phones, data collection for PAR made easy. However, PAR is non-trivial and difficult task due to bulk of data to be processed, complexity and sensor placement positions. Deep learning is found to be scalable and efficient in processing such data. However, the main problem with existing solutions is that, they could recognize up to 6 or 8 actions only. Besides, they suffer from accurate recognition of other actions and also deal with complexity and different placement positions of smart phone. To address this problem, in this paper, we proposed a framework named Robust Deep Personal Action Recognition Framework (RDPARF) which is based on enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model which is trained to recognize 12 actions. RDPARF is realized with our proposed algorithm known as Enhanced CNN for Robust Personal Activity Recognition (ECNN-RPAR). This algorithm has provision for early stopping checkpoint to optimize resource consumption and faster convergence. Experiments are made with MHealth benchmark dataset collected from UCI repository. Our empirical results revealed that ECNN-RPAR could recognize 12 actions under more complex and different placement positions of smart phone besides outperforming the state of the art exhibiting highest accuracy with 96.25%. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

The age group under 10 years is very sensitive, if any child who falls can face injuries which will affect them in terms of mental and physical disability or fatal injuries can also be caused in some cases. Similar for the age group of above 60 is also crucial if they got any kind of injury due to falling and by the time if they didn’t get any medical treatment so it will cause a decisive loss for that person. In the present era we are living in the age of 4G and 3D technology which means in this era everyone is connected with each other by means of smart phone and internet, also the smart wearable devices, which will be connected with human beings and send a kind of information signal through the medium of internet which is commonly known as Internet of Things (IoT). According to this kind of technology we are able to rectify the injury causing by collapsing on the ground. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient smart wearable IoT device which is able to detect the motion of human body and based on that it will detect the collapsing motion and immediately take action by sending data to the cloud server via internet which will immediately send an SMS to the concerned person. Apart from that we also introduce one more feature which is panic alert, so if anyone who need any emergency support, this wearable device will send an SMS to the concerned person. Here we used ESP8266-01 for the communication channel, for the calculation of body motion we use ADXL335 and for the reduction of power we used ATTINY85 which will reduce the ample of energy and utilize the power intelligently which results in the long life of 220 mAh battery. Its battery back-up is approximately up to 3000 h which is extremely far better than all the previous existing approaches. © 2023 IETE.","Energy efficient; IoT; Smart; SMS; Wearable; WSN","Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; mHealth; Motion analysis; Smartphones; Wearable technology; Age groups; Energy efficient; Motion detection; Power; Smart; Smart wearables; SMS; Wearable; Wearable devices; WSN; Internet of things","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097880984"

Rehabilitation via a digital pathway is fraught with difficulties, but advances in technology and research have enabled it to be used to the greatest extent possible in this disaster. Digital health has increased its efficacy in response to the pandemic, as it is now available in developing countries where there is an inability to visit a clinic for rehabilitation, and now the rehabilitation tool is accessible to the patients in their hands and they can connect to their therapist at any time. The rehabilitation is designed based on the patient’s illness, feedback, and health data stored on the application devices, which regulate and provide feedback from both sides, from the patient and other improvement changes gathered with the help of digital applications. Digital health allows for online consultation, assessment, and 24-h monitoring, all of which are directly shared with the rehabilitation team. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Algorithmic medicine; Covid-19; Digital rehabilitation; E-health; M-health; Telemedicine","Developing countries; Digital devices; mHealth; Telemedicine; Algorithmic medicine; Algorithmics; Covid-19; Digital applications; Digital rehabilitation; E health; Health data; M-health; Medical professionals; Patient rehabilitation","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150483888"

One strategy for increasing exclusive breastfeeding is through community-based programs that use peer counselors for education and support. The use of mobile health applications is also gaining increasing applicability in these countries. Minimal information is available about training peer counselors in the use of mobile technologies to support exclusive breastfeeding. The present article describes our curriculum in the state of Karnataka, India for supporting new mothers to exclusively breastfeed using a mobile health application in rural India. Methods: Twenty-five women from the community surrounding the city of Belgavi, Karnataka, India were trained to be peer counselors and to use a mobile health application to conduct a structured curriculum to support new mothers in exclusive breastfeeding. The three-day interactive training, conducted in March 2018, was based on the WHO breastfeeding course, translated, and adapted to the local culture The curriculum, which included information collected during a formative research process, consisted of eight visits, two during the antenatal period and continuing for six months postpartum. Twelve nursing and obstetric experts validated curriculum content. Pre-post-evaluation of the training focused on breastfeeding knowledge, self-efficacy, skills, and app usability. Results: We observed a significant increase in the mean scores for knowledge (P < 0.0001) and skills (P = 0.0006) from pre- to post-training. Age of the peer counselors and their own breastfeeding experience correlated significantly with the acquisition of knowledge and skills. The mobile health app showed high usability scores. Conclusions: The culturally adapted curriculum presented here, combined with an mHealth app, can be an important educational strategy for training rural women in the acquisition of exclusive breastfeeding knowledge and skills. © 2023, The Author(s).","Breastfeeding; Exclusive breastfeeding; mHealth application; Peer counseling; Training curriculum","Breast Feeding; Counseling; Curriculum; Female; Humans; India; Infant; Milk, Human; Pregnancy; Telemedicine; breast feeding; breast milk; counseling; curriculum; female; human; India; infant; pregnancy; psychology; telemedicine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146574241"

Despite their proliferation, several mHealth interventions in developing countries fail to reach geographical scale, and long-term sustainability for most remains uncertain. There is a need to cost for such programs, to enable better planning and budgeting and tailor programs as required. Cost estimates can contribute to a more informed debate on resource allocation priorities and help make choices clearer for policymakers. This paper has two main objectives: (1) present a detailed protocol on determining the costs of a large national mHealth job aid and behavior change communication tool known as Integrated Child Development Services - Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) in India, and (2) to present lessons for policymakers on how to ensure financial planning for scaling mHealth interventions. The study uses the Activity Based Costing—Ingredients (ABC-I) method. The major advantage of the ABC-I method is the clarity it brings to costs for each input and activity, across levels and geographies. It also accounts for indirect costs. There are five key lessons while costing for mHealth programs. First, that there are many activities and ingredients that must be budgeted for and discussed while planning and implementing mHealth programs. Second, the ABC-I method described in this paper provides great clarity on costs, yet its major limitation is the availability of data, which must be mitigated with the careful use of assumptions. Third, mHealth technology life cycles have financial implications which must be accounted for. Fourth, determining cost locations and all sources of funding including non-government sources is crucial. Fifth, since costing estimates are subject to a set of assumptions, a disaggregation of costs allows for scenario-building, which is useful while planning ahead and accounting for program changes. The evidence generated can be used for more informed debate on resource allocation priorities, given competing priorities in low- and middle-income countries.

Pharmacological and surgical interventions are primary modes of treatment. Cognitive/behavioural management approaches and interventional pain management strategies are approaches that have been used to assist with the management of chronic pain. Accurate data collection and reporting treatment outcomes are vital to addressing the challenges faced. In light of this, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the current digital application landscape within chronic pain medicine. Objective: The primary objective was to consider the prevalence of digital application usage for chronic pain management. These digital applications included mobile apps, web apps, and chatbots. Data sources: We conducted searches on PubMed and ScienceDirect for studies that were published between 1st January 1990 and 1st January 2021. Study selection: Our review included studies that involved the use of digital applications for chronic pain conditions. There were no restrictions on the country in which the study was conducted. Only studies that were peer-reviewed and published in English were included. Four reviewers had assessed the eligibility of each study against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Out of the 84 studies that were initially identified, 38 were included in the systematic review. Data extraction and synthesis: The AMSTAR guidelines were used to assess data quality. This assessment was carried out by 3 reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Before data collection began, the primary outcome was to report on the standard mean difference of digital application usage for chronic pain conditions. We also recorded the type of digital application studied (e.g., mobile application, web application) and, where the data was available, the standard mean difference of pain intensity, pain inferences, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Results: 38 studies were included in the systematic review and 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The digital interventions were categorised to web and mobile applications and chatbots, with pooled standard mean difference of 0.22 (95% CI: −0.16, 0.60), 0.30 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.60) and −0.02 (95% CI: −0.47, 0.42) respectively. Pooled standard mean differences for symptomatologies of pain intensity, depression, and anxiety symptoms were 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.46), 0.30 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.43) and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.69), respectively. A sub-group analysis was conducted on pain intensity due to the heterogeneity of the results (I2 = 82.86%; p = 0.02). After stratifying by country, we found that digital applications were more likely to be effective in some countries (e.g., United States, China) than others (e.g., Ireland, Norway). Conclusions and relevance: The use of digital applications in improving pain-related symptoms shows promise, but further clinical studies would be needed to develop more robust applications.

Spending on health is a significant portion of people’s income. Traditional medicine is prone to long delays, waste of money and effort, and even death. RVO (Remote Victim Observation) can be utilized to circumvent problems associated with traditional healthcare facilities because of IoT’s intelligence and predictive power. With the help of IoT-based RVO and wearable devices, sensor networks, and other digital infrastructure, we can detect oncoming situations before they become life-threatening or even fatal. IoT integration with healthcare units was demonstrated in order to build a trustworthy, available, and secure RVO system. Secure end to end communication, encryption of RFID data, and privacy protection are all part of the proposed solution. An android wearable watch (Biosensor | Body sensor), a server using REST framework, and a smartphone app to monitor and detect falls, blood pressure, and heart rate are all part of the system. As a bonus, the peace and quiet of this secluded location contribute to the attraction.

The distribution of EHRs has prodigious optimistic connotation for investigation of disease and doctors’ diagnosis. This radical model empowers healthcare amenities with truncated operating charge, high flexibility, as well as EHRs accessibility. It is of paramount significance to hitch therapeutic evidence sprinkled through healthcare establishments to provision exhaustive data investigation and accomplish custom-made healthcare. Nevertheless, this newfangled archetype also nurtures apprehensions about data privacy in addition to network security for healthcare schemes. Exactly how to steadfastly stake data among mobile consumers while pledging sophisticated security echelons in cloud is a perplexing concern. Blockchain, by means of a public ledger pigeonholed through its transparency, tamper-evidence, decentralization, unforgeability, verifiability, as well as anonymity can support in forming a secure healthcare scheme. Existing works primarily recompense devotion to centralized in addition to Blockchain-based mechanisms. Nonetheless, they could not acclimatize to the snowballing volume of global medical records and agonize from multifaceted application encounters, singly. In this paper, the authors recommend a Diagonal Digital Signature Algorithm (DDSA) with Merkle Patricia Hash Trie (MPHT) algorithm which is an innovative EHRs sharing framework that exploits Blockchain to expedite secure medical record sharing amid dissimilar patients and surgeons.

In this study, we translated the application to Marathi for pilot testing in Pune, India in order to evaluate its impact on user satisfaction and asthma knowledge among adult asthma patients. Methods: ASTHMAXcel© was adapted to Marathi with the help of asthma patients and clinicians from Bharati Hospital. 57 different asthma patients were then recruited and received the Asthma Knowledge Questionnaire (AKQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Mini-AQLQ) to complete at baseline. Study participants then completed the adapted ASTHMAXcel© application. Post-intervention, participants filled out a post-AKQ and Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS). A subset of participants was also interviewed for qualitative feedback. Paired t-tests and Pearson’s correlation were used for statistical analysis. Results: Mean AKQ improved from 5.0+/−2.4 to 12.4+/−1.6 (p = 0.0001). QUIS results revealed that participants were highly satisfied with the application, scoring an average of 50 out of 54 maximum points. Better baseline asthma control was correlated with greater overall experience with the application (–0.110, p = 0.0417). Finally, the qualitative feedback revealed four themes for future refinement. Conclusion: The adapted version of ASTHMAXcel© was linked to significant improvement in patient asthma knowledge and a high level of user satisfaction. These results support the potential utility of mHealth applications in promoting guideline-based asthma care in India.

Despite the possible benefits of mHealth, the effectiveness of these interventions ultimately depends on whether citizens use those initiatives. The current study have thus sought to explore mHealth applications’ adoption behavior. A cross-sectional investigation process has been employed on 440 potential consumers from North India to enumerate the consumers’ intention and their adoption. In addition to the core constituents highlighted in previous studies, this research focuses more on the relationship of several other factors affecting behavioral intentions and their eventual impact on the acceptance of mHealth apps. The key considerations in the current study are the inclusion of trust in the existing UTAUT model and the mediating role of behavioral intentions in determining mHealth services adoption. © 2022 K.J.

Also, m-health services are considered more valuable, mainly where facilities are deficient. In addition, it supports wired and advanced wireless technologies for data transmission and communication. In this work, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based deep learning model is implemented to predict healthcare data, where the data handling is performed to improve the dynamic prediction performance. It includes the working modules of data collection, normalization, AI-based classification, and decision-making. Here, the m-health data are obtained from the smart devices through the service providers, which comprises the health information related to blood pressure, heart rate, glucose level, etc. The main contribution of this paper is to accurately predict Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD) from the patient dataset stored in cloud using the AI-based m-health system. After obtaining the data, preprocessing can be performed for noise reduction and normalization because prediction performance highly depends on data quality. Consequently, we use the Gorilla Troop Optimization Algorithm (GTOA) to select the most relevant functions for classifier training and testing.

Our study aimed to perform a scoping review to evaluate the impact and trends of mobile application-based interventions on adherence and their effects on health outcomes among the cancer population. In addition, we aimed to develop a taxonomy of mobile-app-based interventions to assist app developers and healthcare researchers in creating future mHealth cancer care solutions. Relevant articles were screened from the online databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, spanning the time period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2022. Of the 4135 articles initially identified, 55 were finally selected for the review. In the selected studies, breast cancer was the focus of 20 studies (36%), while mixed cancers were the subject of 23 studies (42%). The studies revealed that the usage rate of mHealth was over 80% in 41 of the 55 studies, with factors such as guided supervision, personalized suggestions, theoretical intervention foundations, and wearable technology enhancing adherence and efficacy. However, cancer progression, technical challenges, and unfamiliarity with devices were common factors that led to dropouts. We also proposed a taxonomy based on diverse theoretical foundations of mHealth interventions, delivery methods, psycho-educational programs, and social platforms. We suggest that future research should investigate, improve, and verify this taxonomy classification to enhance the design and efficacy of mHealth interventions. © 2023 by the authors.","cancer; health outcomes; intervention; m-health; mobile apps; scoping review; taxonomy; treatment","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151417701"

In that, providing Healthcare for the elderly, people above the age of 60 is a tough nut to crack. The current situation depicts that elderly people prefer independent lifestyles free from outside intrusion which complicates monitoring their physical health at regular intervals. Physical intervention after the onset of COVID-19 is a possibility but should be avoided unless absolutely required due to the virus's aggressive nature. Considering all these problems, we devise a conceptual application framework of Consent Based Monitoring of Elderly with Blockchain. The application acts as a method by which we can monitor the patients at regular intervals in a secure and unbreachable manner. The application takes the consent of the patients on what data they want the application to collect and relay, and the users who can access the data including the medical professional. After this, the medical professional can analyze the data to find any anomalies and provide a diagnosis. Only with the aid of Google Authorization may the patient update the consent-based data. The novelty of the project lies in the usage of Blockchain to maintain anonymity and integrity of the consent based data. The consent based access control lists and policies are stored in Blockchain in a comprehensive schema. The Blockchain is a privately running test only Blockchain specifically used to implement decentralized application development. The backend of the application is solely responsible for uploading and querying the data while communicating with the private Blockchain. The application framework assumes that the patient's data has already been transmitted via smaller edge computing nodes. The application works completely separate from the aforementioned nodes. © 2023 IEEE.","Blockchain; Decentralized; Internet-of-Things (IoT); JavaScript; mHealth Systems; Node.js; Privacy; Security","Authorization; Blockchain; Diagnosis; Ductile fracture; mHealth; Viruses; Block-chain; Decentralised; Elderly people; Internet-of-thing; Javascript; Js; Mhealth system; Node.; Privacy; Security; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161293892"

To resolve this dynamically growing issue of global importance, there is a need to devise an integrated and intelligent solution for the delivery of health monitoring services along with abnormality detection and alert notification. In this work, a remote patient monitoring system (RPMS) has been presented. Internet of things (IoT) and integrated cloud computing technologies are used for the implementation. The system can continuously measure different physiological parameters with the appropriate degree of accuracy required by medical standards. A mobile application has been developed for Android devices, which acts as a gateway between RPMS and the Cloud. The developed mobile application offers visualization and storage of physiological parameters locally as well as in Cloud along with real-time data transmission for remote monitoring and further analysis. In case of an abnormal event and emergency, the system can generate an alert notification to the local user and remote supervisor. The RPMS has been implemented and validated on the state-of-the-art patient monitoring system. A series of tests have been carried out to validate the system’s effectiveness and reliability for measuring different physiological parameters and its remote monitoring in real-time.

Aims: To describe the process of mHealth study; Oncology Education and Training for Providers using Mobile Phones which developed a mobile application (M-OncoEd) to educate physicians on approaches to early detection of curable cancers. It also aims to describe how the insight gained through qualitative research by the researchers was used in the design and implementation of the project. Methodology: Qualitative research methods were used in all the phases of the study. Phenomenology was used in the formative phase with three expert meetings, two Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and five In-depth Interviews (IDI), and during the implementation stage with two FGDs, three IDI, and five informal discussions. Observations: The majority of curable cancers are detected at a late stage and poorly managed in India, and active engagement of primary care physicians can have a significant impact on cancer outcomes. There is a lack of knowledge and skills for early detection of cancers among consultants and physicians and this can be attributed to the training gap. M-OncoEd was a need-based well designed engaging learning platform to educate primary care physicians on Breast, Cervical, and Oral Cancer early detection. It was found to be very useful by the beneficiaries and made them more confident for early detection of cancers from the community. Conclusions: This research study could design a need-based, cost-effective mobile-based learning tool for primary care physicians using the expertise and experience of the experts in cancer care using qualitative methods.

In type 2 diabetes treatment, insulin therapy is used after oral or other injectable agents become inadequate to achieve glycemic control. Despite the advances in insulin therapy, management of diabetes remains challenging. Numerous studies have reported low adherence and persistence to insulin therapy, which acts as a barrier to successful glycemic control and diabetes management. The aim of this targeted review article is to provide an overview of adherence and persistence to insulin therapy in people with diabetes and to discuss the impact of the emergence of a new connected ecosystem of increasingly sophisticated insulin pens, glucose monitoring systems, telemedicine, and mHealth on diabetes management. With the emergence of a connected diabetes ecosystem, we have entered an era of advanced personalized insulin delivery, which will have the potential to enhance diabetes self-management and clinical management. Early systems promise to unlock the potential to address missed or late bolus insulin delivery, which should help to address non-adherence and non-persistence. Over time, improvements in this ecosystem have the potential to combine insulin data with previously missing contextualized patient data, including meal, glucose, and activity data to support personalized clinical decisions and ultimately revolutionize insulin therapy. © 2021 Diabetes Technology Society.","adherence; and persistence; diabetes; digital health; insulin; mobile apps","Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Ecosystem; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; insulin; antidiabetic agent; insulin; behavior change; blood glucose monitoring; bolus injection; diabetes mellitus; diet; drug therapy; ecosystem; exercise; glucose blood level; glycemic control; health care cost; health care personnel; health service; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin treatment; Internet; mobile application; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient coding; practice guideline; public health problem; Review; self care; sociodemographics; telecommunication; telemedicine; wireless communication; ecosystem; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102137845"

Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data compression; Energy efficiency; mHealth applications; Physiological signal compression; Spindle Convolutional Auto-encoder","Biomedical signal processing; Deep learning; Electrocardiography; Electrophysiology; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; mHealth; Physiological models; Remote control; Signal encoding; Auto encoders; Mhealth application; Physiological signal compression; Physiological signals; Reconstruction error; Signal compression; Spindle convolutional auto-encoder; State of the art; Stress recognition; Wearable devices; Article; autoencoder; body temperature; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; data compression; deep learning; electrocardiogram; electrodermal response; feed forward neural network; heart arrhythmia; human; internet of things; oxygen saturation; photoelectric plethysmography; pulse rate; telehealth; Convolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120708188"

Objective: This study aimed to determine whether a respiratory-responsive vocal biomarker (RRVB) model platform initially trained on an asthma and healthy volunteer (HV) data set can differentiate patients with active COVID-19 infection from asymptomatic HVs by assessing its sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratio (OR). Methods: A logistic regression model using a weighted sum of voice acoustic features was previously trained and validated on a data set of approximately 1700 patients with a confirmed asthma diagnosis and a similar number of healthy controls. The same model has shown generalizability to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, and cough. In this study, 497 participants (female: n=268, 53.9%; <65 years old: n=467, 94%; Marathi speakers: n=253, 50.9%; English speakers: n=223, 44.9%; Spanish speakers: n=25, 5%) were enrolled across 4 clinical sites in the United States and India and provided voice samples and symptom reports on their personal smartphones. The participants included patients who are symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative as well as asymptomatic HVs. The RRVB model performance was assessed by comparing it with the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. Results: The ability of the RRVB model to differentiate patients with respiratory conditions from healthy controls was previously demonstrated on validation data in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, and cough, with ORs of 4.3, 9.1, 3.1, and 3.9, respectively. The same RRVB model in this study in COVID-19 performed with a sensitivity of 73.2%, specificity of 62.9%, and OR of 4.64 (P<.001). Patients who experienced respiratory symptoms were detected more frequently than those who did not experience respiratory symptoms and completely asymptomatic patients (sensitivity: 78.4% vs 67.4% vs 68%, respectively). Conclusions: The RRVB model has shown good generalizability across respiratory conditions, geographies, and languages. Results using data set of patients with COVID-19 demonstrate its meaningful potential to serve as a prescreening tool for identifying individuals at risk for COVID-19 infection in combination with temperature and symptom reports. Although not a COVID-19 test, these results suggest that the RRVB model can encourage targeted testing. Moreover, the generalizability of this model for detecting respiratory symptoms across different linguistic and geographic contexts suggests a potential path for the development and validation of voice-based tools for broader disease surveillance and monitoring applications in the future. ©Savneet Kaur, Erik Larsen, James Harper, Bharat Purandare, Ahmet Uluer, Mohammad Adrian Hasdianda, Nikita Arun Umale, James Killeen, Edward Castillo, Sunit Jariwala.","artificial intelligence; asthma; COVID-19; eHealth; machine learning; mHealth; mobile health; mobile phone; respiratory; respiratory symptom; respiratory-responsive vocal biomarker; RRVB; smartphones; sound; speech; vocal; vocal biomarkers; voice","Aged; Asthma; Cough; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiratory Insufficiency; acoustics; adult; aged; Article; asthma; body temperature; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease severity; female; human; India; interstitial lung disease; machine learning; major clinical study; male; predictive value; respiratory responsive vocal biomarker model; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; social distancing; United States; voice; asthma; chronic obstructive lung disease; coughing; respiratory failure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152624608"

This article presented novel findings from a study conducted on 464 women from different parts of the country. A mixed-methods approach was employed to understand user perceptions, knowledge, and practices on MTAs. The study indicated good awareness of MTAs. Women use MTAs for various reasons, from tracking their cycles to planning sexual activity. The women in the study had an overall positive outlook toward MTAs. The insights from the study also suggested the need for various stakeholders, such as the app-makers and regulatory bodies, to step in and recognize some of the concerns of the users. These include issues of data privacy, lack of medical grounding, etc. The article also discussed various implications that are relevant for the stakeholders. The study’s findings showed that young women in India are embracing their menstruating bodies with the help of digital tools like MTAs.

It has a wide range of applicability in health monitoring for patients with chronic diseases, gaming consoles for gesture recognition, etc. Sensor-based HAR systems use signals collected over a period of time to label an activity. When we design an efficient sensor-based HAR system, a model requires learning an optimal association of spatial and temporal features. In this article, we propose a sensor-based HAR technique using the deep learning approach. We present a deep reverse transformer-based attention mechanism to guide the side residual features Unlike the conventional bottom-up approaches for feature fusion, we exploit a top-down feature fusion approach. The reverse attention is self-calibrated throughout the course of learning, which regularizes the attention modules and dynamically adjusts the learning rate. The overall framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and is shown to be statistically significant against these methods on five publicly available sensor-based HAR datasets, namely, MHEALTH, USC-HAD, WHARF, UTD-MHAD1, and UTD-MHAD2. Further, we conduct an ablation study to showcase the importance of each of the components of the proposed framework.

IoT devices provide massive amounts of patient data in the healthcare industry. These data stored in the cloud are analyzed using mobile devices' built-in storage and processing power. The Internet of Medical Healthcare Things (IoMHT) integrates health monitoring components including sensors and medical equipment to remotely monitor patient records in order to provide more intelligent and sophisticated healthcare services. In this research, we analyze one of the deadliest illnesses with a high fatality rate worldwide, the chronic kidney disease (CKD), to provide the finest healthcare services possible to users of e-health and m-health applications by presenting the IoTC services based on healthcare delivery system for the prediction and observation of CKD with its severity level. The suggested architecture gathers patient data from linked IoT devices and saves it in the cloud alongside real-time data, pertinent medical records that are collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and relevant medical documents. We further use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier to predict CKD and its severity. To boost the effectiveness of the DNN classifier, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based feature selection technique is also applied.

However, few studies have addressed user perceptions of T2DM mHealth applications (apps) in India. The purpose of this study was to determine the usability and compare results of an mHealth app designed to improve T2DM health literacy among specific populations in India. Design: Comparative survey design. Setting: Bengaluru, India. Method: A descriptive comparative design was used. The mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was used to research the usability of the T2DM mHealth app. Participants (N = 95) were recruited via email and WhatsApp. They were first asked to use the mHealth app and then complete a usability questionnaire. Results: Participants in the study were mainly single (86.3%), women (95.8%), aged 18–28 years (89.5%), with some college education (63.8%), unemployed (90.5%), living in an urban area (76.8%) and not previously diagnosed with T2DM (93.6%). Mean responses (1 = disagree; 7 = agree) ranged from 5.89 (SD, 1.48) to 6.22 (SD, 1.42) favouring the app’s usability. Users recommended incorporating more knowledge and information into the app as an idea for improvement. Results showed that there was no significant difference in scores by age, gender, marital status, employment or previous diagnosis rates and responses to the questions. Conclusion: As a result of these findings, we can use the same interface and layout as that used on the mHealth app with more confidence when creating other health education apps. The data revealed areas for improvement in future apps, such as adding more information, additional questions and more language options. Informed by these findings, we may create health literacy apps that are better suited for the user with greater ease of use. © The Author(s) 2022.","App; diabetes; India; mHealth; public health; rural; type II diabetes","adult; Article; comparative study; descriptive research; educational status; female; health education; health literacy; human; India; male; marriage; middle aged; mobile health application usability questionnaire; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; residence characteristics; unemployment; usability; usability testing; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142709150"

HAR is utilized in different applications where valuable information about an individual’s functional ability and lifestyle is needed namely human computer interaction (HCI), military, healthcare, surveillance, etc. The recent advances of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models pave a way for the effective design of HAR under restricted experimental setup and adequate training dataset. Therefore, this study develops a new cuckoo search with deep belief network based HAR and classification, named CSODBN-HAR model. The proposed CSODBN-HAR model mianly classifies six different types of human activities such as standing, sitting, lying, walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. The presented CSODBN-HAR model involves standard scalar approach as a pre-processing step. In addition, the DBN model was utilized for the recognition and classification of human activities. Besides, the CSO algorithm is applied for the hyperparameter tuning of the DBN model so that the recognition rate gets considerably enhanced, shows the novelty of the work. A wide range of experimental result analyses is conducted using benchmark dataset and the outcomes are assessed under different aspects.

Inspired by the tremendous processing power of cloud computing, the training process and the model repository of deep learning are moved to the cloud. Cloud-assisted deep learning applications enable smart mobile users to experience quick predictive results. Health professionals use smart mobile devices to convey recordings of the patient and to receive the best inference results. The mobility of these devices causes severe performance degradation as it increases the distance between its current location and the edge cloud where the virtual machines are provisioned. Therefore, mobility-based resource provisioning to identify a suitable server based on deadline constraints, available resources, and cost metrics is crucial.

The proposed technique comprises two algorithms (a) deadline-based initial resource provisioning and (b) resource migration and provisioning at suitable cloudlet during location change.

In the teledermatology healthcare framework, the smartphone can acquire dermatology medical images for remote diagnosis. The dermatology medical image is vulnerable to attacks during transmission, resulting in malicious tampering or privacy data disclosure. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a watermarking scheme that doesn't tamper with the dermatology medical image and doesn't disclose the dermatology healthcare data. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning framework with privacy protection and secure encryption technology. Therefore, this paper presents a robust zero-watermarking scheme based on federated learning to solve the privacy and security issues of the teledermatology healthcare framework. This scheme trains the sparse autoencoder network by federated learning. The trained sparse autoencoder network is applied to extract image features from the dermatology medical image. Image features are undergone to two-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-DCT) in order to select low-frequency transform coefficients for creating zero-watermarking. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has more robustness to the conventional attack and geometric attack and achieves superior performance when compared with other zero-watermarking schemes. The proposed scheme is suitable for the specific requirements of medical images, which neither changes the important information contained in medical images nor divulges privacy data.  © 2013 IEEE.","federated learning; IoMT; sparse autoencoder network; Zero-watermarking","Algorithms; Computer Security; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Privacy; Cryptography; Dermatology; Diagnosis; Discrete cosine transforms; Feature extraction; Image watermarking; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Medical problems; mHealth; Network security; Watermarking; Auto encoders; Collaborative Work; Features extraction; Federated learning; Internet of medical thing; Medical services; Privacy protection; Sparse autoencoder network; Watermarking schemes; Zero-watermarking; article; data privacy; discrete cosine transform; encryption; feature extraction; health data; Internet; machine learning; medical service; security; sparse autoencoder; teledermatology; algorithm; computer security; health care delivery; human; privacy; Data privacy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118558142"

The interest in interactive and dynamic telehealth treatments for LBP continues to grow, and it is important for the medical community to remain up-to-date on the state of the science. Literature survey: Relevant studies published from March 2016 until March 2021 were identified through a systematic search of EMBASE, MedLine, and Web of Science. The search strategy combined the concepts of back pain, telehealth, and mobile applications. Methodology: Titles and abstracts were screened to select full-text randomized controlled trials or protocols, and methodological quality and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Data were synthesized narratively. Synthesis: We included seven concluded randomized-controlled trials and two study protocols reporting mobile health (mHealth) solutions for LBP. Six of the seven concluded trials found a significant improvement in self-reported numerical pain rating scale compared to the control group. A single trial compared a mHealth solution to physical therapy, with the majority of studies comparing interventions to “usual care.” Substantial heterogeneity in reporting of sample characteristics was found, indicating a lack of standardization through the field. Conclusions: mHealth solutions may positively impact people with LBP. Larger trials should be encouraged and the field should coalesce around a set of baseline variables for collection and reporting. Because many interventions involve patient engagement, future trials should aim to further quantify adherence levels and begin to define telehealth “doses” associated with better outcomes. © 2021 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123866174"

As a result of failing to provide adequate clinical attention to patients at the appropriate time, many people are facing the possibility of an untimely death. Ultimately, the goal was to develop an IoT-based integrated healthcare monitoring framework that could be relied upon by healthcare professionals to screen their patients, whether they were in the hospital or at home, to ensure that they were being well-cared for. A mobile phone-based remote healthcare monitoring framework has been constructed with the help of sensors, an information acquisition unit, a microcontroller (such as Arduino), and a product modification. This framework has the potential to provide continuous web-based data regarding a patient's physiological states (i.e., JAVA). Before transmitting it to the specialist's portable device along with the application, the framework examines the patient's temperature, heart rate, and EEG data. It then displays and saves this information. An Internet of Things-based patient monitoring framework may monitor a patient's health condition in an efficient manner and save the patient's life at the appropriate moment.  © 2023 IEEE.","Arduino; data acquisition unit; IoT; JAVA; mobile application etc","Internet of things; Java programming language; mHealth; Remote patient monitoring; Arduino; Data-acquisition units; Health control; Healthcare monitoring; IoT; JAVA; Mobile application etc; Mobile applications; Monitoring frameworks; Patient health; Data acquisition","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156174700"

With the evolution of mobile edge computing, numerous security and privacy issues have been addressed including policy management, authentication, access control, and confidentiality. The technologies such as big-data, Internet of Things, and cloud have improved the development of modern healthcare systems to improve the quality of medical services. It is nowadays integrating the computing methods and communication technologies such as wireless sensor networks, radio frequency identification, smartphones, and location awareness to collect and analyze the physiological data of the patient. The e-Health entities such as medical device, client, and server rely on analytical models to carry out early diagnosis and remote monitoring. As it is based on e-Health applications, a real-time healthcare system is preferred to integrate with mobile cloud computing. Since the medical data are hugely exposed to vulnerabilities, a lightweight privacy-aware secure authentication (LPASA) scheme is presented. To achieve better secure efficiencies, this article is preferable to use lightweight cryptographic operations, namely, one-way hashing function and bitwise exclusive-OR. Moreover, the formal and informal security analysis shows that the proposed LPASA can withstand the possible active and passive attacks such as replay, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, online-guessing, and so forth. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed LPASA scheme achieves a better quality of services in terms of packet delivery ratio, energy consumption per data delivery bit, and percentage of packets with low latency to adopt in resource-constrained environments. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","authentication; cyber-physical systems; Internet of Things and cloud; privacy; security; smart healthcare","Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Diagnosis; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Information management; Internet of things; mHealth; Mobile cloud computing; Network security; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Real time systems; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication scheme; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Internet of thing and cloud; Location awareness; Privacy; Privacy aware; Secure authentications; Security; Smart healthcare; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111527833"

Twenty-three apps were available in English only. The output features of the selected apps were food, growth, development and vaccine trackers, data export, reminders, meal planner, feeding tips, list of food, recipes details, information about nutrients, and question/answer session with the expert. Only eight apps provided access to consultation with experts and three suggested nutrient requirements of the child. Three apps scored similarly based on features, although the feature types differed. Findings from this review suggest that the apps do not follow any uniform guidelines for delivering the child nutrition information to the caregivers. About 50% of apps did not mention the consulted source for its development, indicating the unavailability of uniform guidelines or policy documents for child nutrition app development.

For remote health applications, e-health monitoring devices are becoming more and more popular. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were recently thought to be the most common chronic illnesses among patients. Therefore, it is necessary to have more diagnosis and medical therapy and also requires transformation of information from cardiac patients to distant hospitals. There are some challenges according to the devices to take over like excess energy consumption, excessive power consumption, data protection, storage space as well as transmission rate. In addition to that, the Real-time processing of electrocardiogram (ECG) data is required, and the captured data must have high accuracy and lossless compression. A SPIHT decoder with enhanced capabilities of Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Tree has been designed for signal processing. The transmission of the ECG signal on a wireless channel is seriously impacted by numerous disturbances because of the inadequate channel in medical applications. Input database can be taken using the database named as MIT-BIH and was developed on Xilinx platform and MATLAB. SPIHT decoder results can be estimated by different algorithms and also measured the parameters like to demonstrate its effectiveness, it is compared to existing designs and measured for the Compression Ratio (CR), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Percentage Root Mean Square Difference (PRD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Many ECG recordings from the Arrhythmia Database are used in the tests for this lossy compression/decompression technique. The collected results show how the suggested method can increase compression ratio while preserving high signal quality. © 2023 IEEE.","ECG signal compression; m-Health applications; Noise removal; SPIHT decoder; Wavelets","Database systems; Decoding; Digital storage; Diseases; Energy utilization; Mean square error; Medical applications; mHealth; Patient treatment; Signal to noise ratio; E health; Ehealth; Electrocardiogram signal; Electrocardiogram signal compression; Health monitoring devices; M-health application; Noises removal; Signal compression; SPIHT decoder; Wavelet; Electrocardiograms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158141406"

There is a surge in mHealth technologies delivering such interventions. This review aims to explore the concept, context and methodology of implementation of such mHealth apps. Evidence Acquisition: A search was conducted using NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) healthcare database, including keyword ‘early intervention,’ ‘mHealth,’ ‘parent support,’ ‘apps,’ and ‘autism.’ The quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods, case reports, grey literature, systematic reviews, clinical trials, and feasibility studies of children between 2 to 6 years with ASD were included from inception of database to December, 2021. Web/Internet-based or computer-dependent programs were excluded. The initial search yielded 3786 studies; 17 were finally included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: Studies on a total of mhealth apps were reviewed. Nine apps, apart from TOBY (Therapy outcome by you), lacked a holistic approach and instead targeted a specific difficulty in autism. The provision of support to parents using apps was equally beneficial as in-person support, reduced costs, and improved outcomes in children. Conclusion: The review revealed limited evidence-based mHealth apps available currently in a community setting. This also underscores an opportunity for clinicians to re-direct parents towards evidence-based information and interventions. © 2023, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.","Digital technology; Early digital intervention; eHealth; Mobile application-based support; Parental support","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Humans; Mobile Applications; Parents; Telemedicine; autism; Childhood Autism Rating Scale; communication skill; early intervention; human; language development; parent; psychoeducation; Review; social media; social support; telehealth; toilet training; treatment outcome; autism; child; child development; child parent relation; mobile application; preschool child; telemedicine","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150225798"

Detecting smoking activity accurately among the confounding activities of daily living (ADLs) being monitored by the wearable device is a challenging and intriguing research problem. This study aims to develop a machine learning based modeling framework to identify the smoking activity among the confounding ADLs in real-time using the streaming data from the wrist-wearable IMU (6-axis inertial measurement unit) sensor. A low-cost wrist-wearable device has been designed and developed to collect raw sensor data from subjects for the activities. A sliding window mechanism has been used to process the streaming raw sensor data and extract several time-domain, frequency-domain, and descriptive features. Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection have been done to identify best hyperparameters and features respectively. Subsequently, multi-class classification models are developed and validated using in-sample and out-of-sample testing. The developed models obtained predictive accuracy (area under receiver operating curve) up to 98.7% for predicting the smoking activity. The findings of this study will lead to a novel application of wearable devices to accurately detect smoking activity in real-time. It will further help the healthcare professionals in monitoring their patients who are smokers by providing just-in-time intervention to help them quit smoking. The application of this framework can be extended to more preventive healthcare use-cases and detection of other activities of interest. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","IoT; mHealth; Multimedia applications; Personalized healthcare; Predictive modeling; Preventive healthcare; Smoking cessation; Wearable sensors","Classification (of information); Frequency domain analysis; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; mHealth; Patient treatment; Smoke; Wearable sensors; Activities of Daily Living; Just-in-time; Multimedia applications; Personalized healthcare; Predictive models; Preventive healthcare; Raw sensor; Real- time; Smoking cessations; Wearable devices; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125185869"

Our application, WashKaro, is a multi-pronged intervention that uses conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine translation, and natural language processing to combat misinformation (NLP). WashKaro uses AI to provide accurate information matched against WHO recommendations and delivered in an understandable format in local languages. The primary aim of this study was to assess the use of neural models for text summarization and machine learning for delivering WHO matched COVID-19 information to mitigate the misinfodemic. The secondary aim of this study was to develop a symptom assessment tool and segmentation insights for improving the delivery of information. A total of 5026 people downloaded the app during the study window; among those, 1545 were actively engaged users. Our study shows that 3.4 times more females engaged with the App in Hindi as compared to males, the relevance of AI-filtered news content doubled within 45 days of continuous machine learning, and the prudence of integrated AI chatbot “Satya” increased thus proving the usefulness of a mHealth platform to mitigate health misinformation. We conclude that a machine learning application delivering bite-sized vernacular audios and conversational AI is a practical approach to mitigate health misinformation. © 2022, The Author(s).","","COVID-19; Disinformation; Female; Global Health; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Natural Language Processing; Pandemics; epidemiology; female; global health; human; machine learning; male; natural language processing; pandemic","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123091271"

At the present, electronic health records (EHRs) including the medical history of the patient, laboratory tests, demographics, medication and allergies, immunization status, radiology images, vital signs allare all are hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, whichcreates which creates biggest obstacles to data exchange, analyze, and interpret. Healthcare sector is realizing the thrust of a system which allows healthcare facilities to access, analyze, and enhanced communication between systems, medical devices, and applications at a local or cross-organizational level. Application Programming Interface (API) integration has become the most popular solution for managing the flow of data between internal applications, EHRs, and other data exchange tools in the healthcare industry by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely. In this paper, we suggest that interoperability is a must for most of the upcoming medical advancements. Among various examples of emerging technologies likeIoT, like IoT, SaaS and cloud computing, APIs are the best tool in order to maximise maximize the performance in terms of earning more income, better understanding their customers, etc. The paper highlights the benefits of API and suggests a framework of API led integration to improve the interoperability of patient health information between healthcare organizations while maintaining the privacy and security of data. © 2023 The Author(s)","API; Attackers; Deep learning; E-healthcare; Electronic health records; Interoperatability; Led connectivity; Machine learning; Mulesoft; Security; Value-based care","Application programming interfaces (API); Deep learning; E-learning; Electronic data interchange; Integration; Learning systems; Medical computing; Medical imaging; mHealth; Software testing; Applications programming interfaces; Attacker; Deep learning; E-healthcare; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Interoperatability; Lead connectivity; Machine-learning; Mulesoft; Security; Value-based; Value-based care; Interoperability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151552514"

With the increasing growth of the internet and technology, personalized health interventions including smartphones, associated apps, and other interventions demonstrate prowess in various health fields, including cardiovascular management. This systematic review thus examines the effectiveness of various human–computer interactions technologies through telehealth (mainly eHealth) towards optimizing the outcomes in cardiovascular treatment. Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases using key terms was conducted from 2000 to November 2021 to identify suitable studies that explored the use of human–computer interaction technologies to provide a personalized care approach to facilitate bolstered outcomes for cardiovascular patients, including the elderly. The included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias, and the authors undertook a data extraction task. Results: Ten studies describing the use of a mix of personalized health app (mHealth) interventions were identified and included in the study. Among the included studies, nine of them were randomized trials. All of the studies demonstrated the effectiveness of various personalized health interventions in maximizing the benefits of cardiovascular disease treatment. Conclusions: Personalized health application interventions through precision medicine has great potential to boost cardiovascular disease management outcomes, including rehabilitation. Fundamentally, since each intervention’s focus might differ based on the disease and outcome preference, it is recommended that more research be done to tailor the interventions to specific disease and patient outcome expectations. © 2022 by the authors.","cardiovascular health; human–computer interaction; personalized health","cardiac patient; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular system; Cinahl; clinical effectiveness; data extraction; Embase; geriatric patient; human; human computer interaction; medical technology; Medline; personalized medicine; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; statistical bias; systematic review; telehealth; telerehabilitation; thematic analysis","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136688855"

Involving the social support groups by health education improves cervical cancer screening and early detection of the disease in the community. In the ongoing efforts to strengthen cervical cancer prevention, control, and management, digital health and technology will have a significant role to play. Objective To assess the effectiveness of the mHealth-based intervention on cervical cancer preparedness among women social support groups. Materials & methods A pre-post interventional study was conducted among women social support groups from lower socio-economic status, identified from the field practice area. Purposive sampling technique was employed. A Cervical Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) instrument was used to assess the cancer preparedness among the social support group women After taking inputs from the stakeholders' mobile health application was developed. The mHealth educational intervention was given to 102 women. Both pre-and post-test questionnaires were administered through mHealth application to assess the change in knowledge after a gap of 1 month to 2 months. The data obtained was coded and entered into Microsoft Excel worksheet 2016 and was later imported and analyzed using SPSS version 22 (licensed to the Institute). The difference in median scores of knowledge and practice were interpreted as statistically significant at p value of < 0.05. Results & conclusion Before the intervention only 13 (12.7%) of them had heard about cervical cancer. There was a significant increase in the knowledge about warning signs & symptoms, risk factors of cervical cancer, and HPV vaccination. Around 5% increase in Pap smear test uptake.

Due to easy portability and privacy, inertial sensing based HAR has gained potential research interests. The accelerometer and gyroscope sensors detect the body acceleration and angular acceleration respectively which are essentially time series signals. However, 1D time-series signal patterns are found to be insufficient for recognition of some of the daily activities. Existing HAR works are mostly focused on the recognition of a given bunch of activities rather than finding out what kind of data dimensions and classifiers work best to identify different kind of activities. In this paper, we propose a two-phase deep learning classification approach for activity recognition that handles the problem hierarchically. We have shown that signals for different groups of activities need different preprocessing measures in order to extract effective high dimensional features from them in a later phase. CNNs with different dimensions have been utilized accordingly for automatic extraction of robust features. A combination of temporal pattern analysis and spatial pattern analysis is applied through the proposed approach. SVM has been used to divide the bunch of activities in two classes, static and dynamic. The proposed framework achieves overall accuracy of 95.72% for all activities of the UCI HAR dataset when the training data and the test data are collected from different user subsets. Thus, the results indicate that this approach can be applied to classify data from new set of users as well. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","CNN; Deep learning; Human activity recognition; Signal image; Smartphone","Classification (of information); Deep learning; mHealth; Pattern recognition; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Time series; Deep learning; Human activity recognition; Inertial sensing; ITS applications; Learning frameworks; Potential researches; Signal images; Smart phones; Surveillance applications; Time series signals; Smartphones","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159320230"

Inadequate competencies of health workers, insufficient quality of training and infrastructure, and the financial challenges of providing training across the country impede quality care provision. To this end, the Government of India began exploring cost-effective tech and IT-based solutions to support existing quality improvement (QI) initiatives. Method We describe the process and approach of scaling the Safe Delivery App (hereafter referred to as the App) throughout India. The App is an mHealth learning tool for equipping health workers in managing obstetric and neonatal emergencies by placing evidence-based, and up-to-date clinical guidelines in their hands through their mobile devices. The use of the App was supported by the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health at the state level. Both parties were actively involved in the roll-out of the App and had a clear vision of how the App can complement existing structures/systems/programmes. Results The App was successfully integrated and implemented in various government-led QI initiatives. Approximately 20 000 healthcare workers (HCWs) have been trained on the App and selected clinical topics since its launch, and between 2018 and 2021 over 86 000 HCWs across all states and union territories used the App. Moreover, project-specific data show a significant increase in the knowledge level of users of the App. Conclusion Scaling such a tool within existing programmes is not a linear process. In India, the approach, government buy-in and flexibility of implementation modalities led to the successful roll-out of the App. We have demonstrated that an mHealth tool can be used to support the growing desire of governments to use tech in support existing QI initiatives and supporting the improvement of quality of care provided.  © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","Maternal Health Services; Mobile Applications; Quality improvement","Female; Humans; India; Infant, Newborn; Mobile Applications; Pregnancy; Quality Improvement; Research Design; Telemedicine; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; evidence based practice; fatality; health care personnel; health care quality; human; India; infant mortality; machine learning; maternal care; maternal death; maternal mortality; mentor; midwife; newborn death; newborn mortality; stillbirth; total quality management; female; methodology; mobile application; newborn; pregnancy; telemedicine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136069109"

Hence, the aim of this review was to critically evaluate conservative dentistry and endodontics apps among mobile phone apps. Furthermore, the objective was to assess the quality of apps using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Mobile applications were explored on the Apple App Store (AAS) and Google Play Store (GPS), using search terms and content analysis done using the MARS rating scale which is divided into three categories: app overall quality, app subjective quality, and app specific quality. Statistical analysis used Pearson’s correlations analyzed correlations between app scores and downloads/ratings and ANOVA, to analyze any differences between app focus and mean scores. Recent Findings: Overall MARS scores ranged from 2 to 4.68 with a mean (SD) of 3.40 (0.79). The highest mean score in engagement (4.8/5) and highest esthetic mean score (4.6/5) were noted with an app named “Denticalc.” The highest functionality score (4.88/5) and information domain (4.7/5) belonged to the “AAE Endocase” app. A positive correlation was seen among average user rating score with app subjective mean score and overall mean scores. Summary: To improve the overall quality of apps, developers must take into account both engaging and necessary features with high-quality, evidence-based information.

The long-term use of l-dopa therapy frequently leads to l-dopa-induced dyskinesia and several other non-motor flocculants for fluctuating plasma concentration. To alleviate the adverse effect of dopamine replacement therapy, sensitive detection of l-dopa is still challenging. Therefore, this study presents a simple strategy to develop an inexpensive, easy-to-use, smartphone-based fluorescence turn-on sensory system based on the aggregation-induced emission enhancement phenomenon for instant low-level detection of l-dopa in biological samples. The sensor was fabricated using silk-fibroin-decorated reduced graphene oxide quantum dots, which exhibit a progressive increase of fluorescence intensity in the presence of l-dopa. By measuring the turn-on efficiency of the sensor in elevated concentrations of l-dopa, the limit of detection (LOD) was evaluated as 76.18 nM over a linear range of 0-35 μM. We have further designed a smartphone-based electronic device involving a 365 nm light emitting diode attached below the rare camera for capturing the change of fluorescent color of the solution during sensing. From these images, red, green, and blue values are analyzed using a mobile phone application, and the corresponding LOD was found to be 0.29 μM in a similar linear range of concentration. This simple, cost-effective, and rapid screening gadget is very demanding for on-spot detection of the analytes in remote areas where sophisticated instrumentation is not usually available. © 2023 American Chemical Society","AIE; functionalized reduced graphene oxide; Parkinson’s disease; smart sensor","Amines; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Fluorescence; Graphene; mHealth; Nanocrystals; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Semiconductor quantum dots; AIE; Functionalized; Functionalized reduced graphene oxide; L -dopa; Limit of detection; Parkinson's disease; Reduced graphene oxides; Silk fibroin; Simple++; Smart phones; Smartphones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163336581"

The usability of mHealth applications in controlling HbA1c (estimated average blood glucose) levels is unclear despite their increasing use. The burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is high in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the highest burden in the Indian population. Our objective is to identify the effectiveness of mHealth applications in managing blood glucose levels of individuals with T2DM and to assess the impact of using mHealth applications in managing T2DM concerning health-promoting behaviour among the LMICs in the context of India. Methods and analysis The electronic databases included for search are PubMed, Ovid Medline, EBSCO, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; additional sources of the search will be grey literature available on diabetes management websites and reference lists of included studies. Studies published in the English language in indexed and peer-reviewed sources will be considered. Studies reporting the effectiveness of mobile applications in the management of T2D in LMICs will be eligible for inclusion. The Population-Intervention-Comparison-Outcomes framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement 2021 will be used for reporting. Data analysis will be carried out using narrative synthesis, and a meta-analysis may be conducted if we come across homogenous data for the outcome.

Obesity-related mHealth apps have proffered an exciting opportunity to remotely deliver obesity-related information. This opportunity raises the question of whether such apps are truly effective. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify existing obesity-related mHealth apps in India and evaluate the potential of the apps' contents to promote health behavior change. This study also aimed to discover the general quality of obesity-related mHealth apps. Methods: A systematic search for obesity-related mHealth apps was conducted in both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The features and quality of the sample apps were assessed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and the potential of the sample apps' contents to promote health behavior change was assessed using the PRECEDE-PROCEED Model (PPM). Results: A total of 13 apps (11 from the Google Play Store and 2 from the Apple App Store) were considered eligible for the study. The general quality of the 13 apps assessed using MARS resulted in mean scores ranging from 1.8 to 3.7. The bivariate Pearson correlation between the MARS rating and app user rating failed to establish statistically significant results. The multivariate regression analysis result indicated that the PPM factors are significant determinants of health behavior change (F3,9=63.186; P < .001) and 95.5% of the variance (R2=0.955; P < .001) in the dependent variable (health behavior change) can be explained by the independent variables (PPM factors). Conclusions: In general, mHealth apps are found to be more effective when they are based on theory. The presence of PPM factors in an mHealth app can greatly influence the likelihood of health behavior change among users. So, we suggest mHealth app developers consider this to develop efficient apps. Also, mHealth app developers should consider providing health information from credible sources and indicating the sources of the information, which will increase the perceived credibility of the apps among the users. We strongly recommend health professionals and health organizations be involved in the development of mHealth apps. Future research should include mHealth app users to understand better the apps' effectiveness in bringing about health behavior change. © Shanmuga Nathan Selvaraj, Arulchelvan Sriram","health behavior change techniques; health communication; health information; mHealth apps; Mobile App Rating Scale; obesity; PRECEDE-PROCEED Model","Delivery of Health Care; Health Promotion; Humans; Mobile Applications; Obesity; Telemedicine; health care delivery; health promotion; human; mobile application; obesity; telemedicine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129988456"

Tracking systems capture and read human actions ranging from the identification of plain movements to the comprehension of habits and practices. As such, HARs have found their use in areas such as health care, with a special focus on elderly patients’ care, safety arrangements and supervision areas and in applications designed for smart homes. Sensor and visual devices enable HAR, and there is a multitude of sensor classifications, such as sensors that can be worn, sensors tagged to a target and sensors tagged to the background. The automated learning methodologies in HAR are either handcrafted or deep learning or a combination of both. Handcrafted models can be regional or wholesome recognition models such as RGB, 3D mapping and skeleton data models, and deep learning models are categorized into generative models such as LSTM (long short-term memory), discriminative models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or a synthesis of such models. Several datasets are available for undertaking HAR analysis and representation. The hierarchy of processes in HAR is classified into gathering information, preliminary processing, property derivation and guiding based on framed models. The proposed study considers the role of smartphones in HARs with a particular interest in keeping a tab on the lifestyle of subjects. Smartphones act as HAR devices with inbuilt sensors with custom-made applications, and the merits of both handcrafted and deep learning models are considered in framing a model that can enable lifestyle tracking in real time. This performance-enhanced real-time tracking human activity recognition (PERT-HAR) model is economical and effective in accurate identification and representation of actions of the subjects and thereby provides more accurate data for real-time investigation and remedial measures. This model achieves an accuracy of 97–99% in a properly controlled environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Human activity recognition; Long short-term memory; PERT-HAR","Automation; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Home health care; Intelligent buildings; Learning systems; mHealth; Pattern recognition; Smartphones; Automated learning; Controlled environment; Discriminative models; Human activity recognition; Preliminary processing; Real time tracking; Recognition models; Remedial measures; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115163176"

It includes features such as real-time data entry, automated generation of the work plan, and a decision support system generating alerts for high-risk cases. Since 2019, the programme is implemented across all 33 districts of Gujarat, catering to a population of over 60 million. This study aims to compare changes in the coverage, quality of data reporting maternal and child health services, and time spent in the documentation before and after the introduction of the TeCHO+ app. Methods: To address the study aim, a mixed-method design with a realist evaluation approach was adopted. The survey was conducted with randomly selected beneficiaries from 32 sub-centers across two districts of Gujarat State in India. We surveyed 215 postpartum women and mothers of 102 children at baseline (pre) and 246 postpartum women and mothers of 119 children post 1 year of the TeCHO+ programme intervention in 2020. For qualitative data, total 29 Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, 12 Data Entry Operators and 10 Primary Health Center Medical Officers were purposively selected from 32 PHCs and interviewed to understand the pathways leading to the programme outcome. Results: Following introduction of TeCHO+, the coverage of full antenatal care (ANC; 75.6% vs. 67.9%, p-value < 0.0001), consumption of at least 180 iron-folic acid tablets (93% vs. 77%, p-value < 0.001), early initiation of breastfeeding (42.7% vs. 24.2%, p-value < 0.001), five home-visits by ANM during the first month after delivery (36.2% vs. 27.9%, p-value = 0.056), HBV0 vaccination (67.2% vs. 35.3%, p-value < 0.0001) and Pentavalent 2 (100% vs. 95.1%, p-value = 0.015) improved. The overall concordance rate for routine maternal health indicators (a measure of data quality) improved from 69.1 to 80.5%, while that for routine child health indicators improved from 86.6 to 92.1%. The programme resulted in 1.7 h saving a day of ANM's productive time and 1.5 h (a day) of data entry operator's time. Conclusions: The TeCHO+ programme has improved access to care. It impacted both coverage of maternal and child health services and data reporting quality of various maternal and child high-risk conditions. Considering the programme's success, other disease services might be added to the scope of TeCHO+ software.

Given that more than 27% of the population suffers from iron deficiency anemia, an ample amount of research is being done to find point-of-care ways to diagnose this disease. The traditional methods are invasive and time-consuming. In this letter, we demonstrate a smartphone application that employs image processing techniques like contour and blob detection, morphological opening and closing, and pixel analysis to detect anemia. An algorithm for detecting leukonychia, which is the appearance of white spots or streaks, is developed; leukonychia is an indicator of iron deficiency anemia, and this is detected using an image analysis technique. We can detect anemia with an accuracy of 89% just by analyzing the photograph of nails from an individual; one can diagnose the early onset of anemia. This method demonstrates a low margin of error and high sensitivity of 96% compared to prior arts indicating its usability as an onsite detection technique. The method is employed in available datasets illustrating 89% accuracy overall. Furthermore, this technique is available in the form of an application and hence is very affordable and large-scale deployable in rural set-ups as well. © 2017 IEEE.","anemia; blob detection; Electromagnetic wave sensors; leukonychia; smartphone","Diagnosis; Image analysis; Image sensors; mHealth; Smartphones; Anemia; Blob detection; Image color analysis; Image-based; Iron deficiency; Leuconychia; Sensitivity; Smart phones; Smart-phone applications; Thumb; Iron","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141467795"

Unlike a majority of the existing glucose meters that use whole blood-based indirect sensing technologies, our direct adaptation of the gold-standard laboratory benchmark could eliminate the possibilities of cross interference with other analytes present in the whole blood by facilitating an in situ plasma separation, capillary flow and colorimetric reaction occurring concomitantly, without incurring additional device complexity or embodiment. The test reagents were dispensed in lyophilized form, and the resulting paper strips were found to be stable over three months stored in a normal freezer, rendering easy adaptability commensurate with the constrained supply chains in extreme resource-poor settings. Quantitative results could be arrived at via a completely-automated mobile-app-based image analytics interface developed using dynamic machine learning, obviating manual interpretation. The tests were demonstrated to be of high efficacy, even when executed by minimally trained frontline personnel having no special skill of drawing precise volume of blood, on deployment at under-resourced community centres having no in-built or accessible healthcare infrastructure. Clinical validation using 220 numbers of human blood samples in a double-blinded manner evidenced sensitivity and specificity of 98.11% and 96.7%, respectively, as compared to the results obtained from a laboratory-benchmarked biochemistry analyser, establishing its efficacy for public health and community disease management in resource-limited settings without any quality compromise of the test outcome. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Blood Glucose; Colorimetry; Glucose; Humans; Mobile Applications; Smartphone; Blood; Drops; Glucose; mHealth; Supply chains; glucose; reagent; glucose; Gold standards; Indirect sensing; Low-costs; Plasma glucose; Plasma glucose level; Single users; Single-step; Smart phones; Strip sensors; Whole blood; Article; benchmarking; blood sampling; capillary blood; capillary flow; colorimetry; controlled study; cost; freeze drying; frontline staff; glucose blood level; gold standard; hematocrit; human; limit of detection; machine learning; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; standardization; validation process; venous blood; glucose blood level; mobile application; smartphone; Smartphones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142221666"

With the increase of mHealth applications, it has become more difficult to choose the best applications that are user-friendly and provide user satisfaction. The best techniques for any decision-making challenge are multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies. However, traditional MCDM methods cannot provide accurate results in complex situations. Currently, researchers are focusing on the use of hybrid MCDM methods to provide accurate decisions for complex problems. Thus, the authors in this paper proposed two hybrid MCDM methods, CODAS-FAHP and MOORA-FAHP, to assess the usability of the five most familiar mHealth applications that focus on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on ten criteria. The fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied for efficient weight estimation by removing the vagueness and ambiguity of expert judgment. The CODAS and MOORA MCDM methods are used to rank the mHealth applications, depending on the usability parameter, and to select the best application. The resulting analysis shows that the ranking from both hybrid models is sufficiently consistent. To assess the proposed framework’s stability and validity, a sensitivity analysis was performed. It showed that the result is consistent with the proposed hybrid model. © 2022 by the authors.

Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE), a popular kind of ABE, tags cipher texts with a set of characteristics and connects secret keys to access structures that limit which cipher texts a user can decrypt, Data sharing on unstable cloud storage has a broad range of applications for KP-ABE. The cipher text size, on the other hand, expands exponentially in relation to the number of characteristics in the cypher text in most recognized KP-ABE systems. A novel context-aware Cyber- Physical System that integrates embedded sensors, Internet of Things technologies, and cloud computing is thought to benefit the healthcare industry (CPS). As a result of the intellectualization of mobile terminal devices, mobile healthcare networks are automatically generated. These networks can offer basic health care services as well as real-time communication. However, the CPS has two challenges that need to be solved. The first challenge can be overcome by lowering a mobile terminal's processing and storage expenses. The second challenge can be addressed by providing healthcare data with cyber-physical privacy and security. Data privacy and secure sharing in an open environment can be guaranteed by key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE). Encryption, authentication, and authorization techniques are used to keep data safe. Some of the more complex applications and cryptographic approaches that the KP-ABE system can be used in include event log encryption, selective broadcast encryption, operational encryption, and software obfuscation. An access tree can be used during the key creation process to create fine-grained access control, and users' attribute sets can also be permitted to overlap. This work provides a detailed analysis of the Key Policy Attribute Based Encryption Scheme, allowing the investigator to concentrate on the flaws suchas collusion attacks and make improvements. © 2023 IEEE.","CP-ABE; EHR; EMR; KP-ABE","Application programs; Authentication; Character recognition; Cloud storage; Computer terminals; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Data obfuscation; mHealth; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Attribute-based encryption schemes; Attribute-based encryptions; Ciphertexts; CP-attribute-based encryption; CryptoGraphics; EHR; EMR; Key policies; Key-policy attribute-based encryption; Embedded systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158150214"

A randomized controlled trial (n = 150) demonstrates its utility in improving the quality of antenatal care, reducing obstetric/medical complications and achieving a positive pregnancy experience. The test group (patients registered on the App) showed a significantly higher number of mean (± SD) antenatal visits (7.0 ± 1.5 vs. 5.7 ± 1.8; P < 0.001) as well as better compliance with the WHO visit protocol (87.2% vs. 69.8%, P < 0.001) and antenatal investigations (73.2% vs. 41.7%, P<0.001) in comparison to the control group (followed-up conventionally), respectively. Furthermore, substantial reduction in medical (38.0% vs. 55.5%, P = 0.04) and obstetric (52.1% vs. 59.7%, P = 0.36) complications during pregnancy as well as significant improvement in mean (± SD) maternal systolic BP (118.9 ± 11.8 vs. 123.4 ± 14.2 mmHg; P = 0.046), diastolic BP (76.0 ± 8.4 vs. 80.0 ± 10.9 mmHg; P = 0.02) and hemoglobin (11.5 ± 1.4 vs. 10.9 ± 1.4 g/dL; P = 0.03) parameters at delivery was observed in the test group compared to the controls, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed an action research approach to design and implement a mobile health hypertension education application to help India's most vulnerable populations. The authors used interpretive analysis, guided by the sustainable livelihoods framework, to uncover key findings. Findings: Successfully implementing information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) requires understanding that all stakeholders (i.e. donors, facilitators and the beneficiaries) have important assets to contribute. Facilitators play an important role in connecting donors to the beneficiaries and fostering cultural humility in donors so that the donors will understand the role beneficiaries play in success. Stakeholders may use the ICT4D in unintended ways that both improve the people's health and increase some beneficiaries' financial livelihood. Research limitations/implications: This research expands the definition of information systems success when implementing ICT4D in resource-constrained environments. Success is more than creating an mHealth app that was easy for beneficiaries to use and where they learned based on a pre- and post-test statistical analysis. Success involved development in all the stakeholders impacted by the social innovation collaboration. For the beneficiary community, success included getting screened for noncommunicable diseases as a first step toward treatment. For the facilitator, success involved more resources for their community health program. Amongst the donors, success was a change in perspective and learning cultural humility. Practical implications: Although universities encourage faculty to work in interdisciplinary research teams to address serious world problems, university researchers may have to exert considerable effort to secure contracts, approvals and payments. Unfortunately, universities may not reward this effort to build ICT4D and continue to evaluate faculty based on journal publications. When universities undertake social innovation collaborations, administrators should ensure responsive and flexible university processes as well as appropriate academic reward structures are in place. This need is heightened when collaborations involve international partners with limited resources and time needed to build relationships and understanding across cultures. Social implications: This study discovered the importance of fostering cultural humility as a way of avoiding potential conflicts that may arise from cultural and power differences. Cultural humility moves the focus of donor-beneficiary relationships away from getting comfortable with “them” to taking actions that develop relationships and address vulnerabilities (Fisher-Borne et al., 2015). This research shows how the facilitator helped the donor develop cultural humility by involving the donor in various initiatives with the beneficiary community including allowing the donor to live in a dormitory at the hospital, work in an urban slum and visit health screening campus. Originality/value: This study (1) extends the ICT4D literature by incorporating cultural humility into the sustainable livelihoods framework, (2) provides a contextual understanding of developing cultural humility in ICT4D projects with a complex group of stakeholders and (3) describes how facilitators become a catalyst for change and a bridge to the community. The culturally humble approach suggests revising the livelihood framework to eliminate words like “the poor” to describe beneficiaries. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action research; Cultural humility; Ethics; Grant; ICT4D; Livelihoods framework; Multidisciplinary; Social innovation collaboration; Transdisciplinary","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114149448"

Methods: Principles of relapse prevention and motivation enhancement were used to develop the Quest App. Four addiction psychiatrists reviewed the app using the “app evaluation framework”. Thirty patients (> 18 yrs age) diagnosed with ADS, who had an Android smartphone, were fluent in writing and reading English and agreed to use the app regularly for the next three months were enrolled in this study. After initial treatment for intoxication/withdrawal and with written consent, patients in the study group (TAUQ) were requested to download the Quest application from a downloadable installation file. The usability and acceptability of Quest App amongst TAUQ patients was evaluated using the usability section of the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ). The short-term effectiveness at the end of three months was compared between TAUQ and comparison group who received Treatment as Usual (TAU). Results: Both acceptability (65 %) and usability (5.8 out of 7) of the app were high. The patient groups (with or without Quest app) showed a significant reduction in drinking at 30, 60, and 90 days follow-up compared with their baseline number of drinking days. There was no significant difference between the two groups (with or without Quest App) in the median number of lapses and the median number of days of heavy drinking. Conclusions: This is the first attempt to develop a smartphone app and test its feasibility in preventing relapse among patients with ADS in the Indian population. Further validation of the app after incorporating feedback and testing on a larger sample size and multiple languages is required. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Alcohol dependence syndrome; mHealth; mobile app","Alcoholism; Humans; Mobile Applications; Motivation; Secondary Prevention; Smartphone; alcoholism; human; motivation; secondary prevention","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151484858"

The corrected details are given below: Capturing time and frequency relationships of time-series signals offers an inherent barrier for automatic human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable sensor data. Extracting spatiotemporal context from the feature space of the sensor reading sequence is challenging for the current recurrent, convolutional, or hybrid activity recognition models. The overall classification accuracy also gets affected by large size feature maps that these models generate. To this end, in this work, we have put forth a hybrid architecture for wearable sensor data-based HAR. We initially use continuous wavelet transform to encode the time series of sensor data as multi-channel images. Then, we utilize a spatial attention-aided convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract higher-dimensional features. To find the most essential features for recognizing human activities, we develop a novel feature selection (FS) method. In order to identify the fitness of the features for the FS, we first employ three filter-based methods: mutual information (MI), Relief-F, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). The best set of features is then chosen by removing the lower-ranked features using a modified version of the genetic algorithm (GA). The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier is then used to categorize human activities. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five well-known, publicly accessible HAR datasets, namely UCI-HAR, WISDM, MHEALTH, PAMAP2, and HHAR. Our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of classification performance. We also observe an improvement in overall recognition accuracy with the use of GA-based FS technique with a lower number of features.

TeCHO+ is a mobile and web-based application that essentially enables data entry by the frontline workers providing service at the time and place of service delivery to improve the coverage and data quality. It also facilitates early identification of morbid condition and timely treatment. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of TeCHO+ program in Gujarat. Materials and Methods: The study compared key program outcome indicators before and after the launch of TeCHO+ program. As the program was launched across the State, eMamta, the previous version of mother and child tracking system was used for comparison. A decision tree was parameterized to estimate change in disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and cost as a result of implementing TeCHO+ from a health system perspective. Results: TeCHO+ incurred a cost of Rs. 2,624 per beneficiary against Rs. 1,075 per beneficiary under the previous eMamta program. TeCHO+ has resulted in significant DALY averted through early identification of high-risk cases both among pregnant women and children. Overall, cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that TeCHO+ incurred an incremental cost of Rs. 1802.84 per DALY averted, which is 1.19% of the GDP per capita of India (year 2020). Conclusion: This study concludes that TeCHO+ is cost-effective for mother and child care and can be considered for replicating. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The social setting is very important for this. Communication networks provide uninterrupted internet connectivity for both fixed and mobile devices like PCs and smartphones. Customers may now keep up their level of engagement while interacting with one or more apps at any time and from any location, thanks to developments in information and communication technologies. Many kinds of smart devices might potentially coordinate their responses to events, sending out alerts or keeping records of the system's condition in line with a predetermined policy. Constant progress toward intelligent solutions is improving many facets of modern life, including manufacturing, transportation, electronic healthcare, electronic education, and many more. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in the IoT is autonomous and dynamic. Diverse approaches are being developed to address the challenges posed by disparate data sources, fluctuating signal quality, and overwhelming quantities of data. From the perspectives of intelligent system technologies, security, vulnerabilities, and the potential role that intelligent solutions based on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) may play, this article examines the IoT. Concerns about privacy and safety have arisen as a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT). We propose that the Standard Security Framework (SSF) be made mandatory for all distributed networks to ensure that hardware and software modules may communicate with one another regardless of their respective platforms. In addition, the effectiveness and security of new innovations in using fog and edge computing in conjunction with cloud applications have been studied. . © 2023 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Distributed Security Framework; Internet of Things; Machine Learning","Intelligent systems; Machine learning; mHealth; Mobile security; Network security; Artificial intelligence learning; Communications networks; Distributed security frameworks; Healthcare systems; Intelligent solutions; Internet connectivity; Machine-learning; Smart homes; Smart System; Social settings; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159425314"

Digital mental health applications could potentially decrease this treatment gap; however, these applications should be tailored to meet the needs and overcoming barriers of its end-users to ensure their adoption and sustained usage. Few studies in India have explored the perspectives of target stakeholders to understand how digital tools could be viable for supporting care. Therefore, this study explores the perceived needs and barriers of patients with schizophrenia, caregivers and clinicians in using digital mental health applications. Methods: Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with patients having schizophrenia attending outpatient clinics at a government tertiary hospital, and their caregivers, and mental health clinicians in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. FGDs were audio-recorded and coded. Framework analysis was employed to guide the analysis, involving deductive and inductive generation of themes, data triangulation and comparison of perspectives between participant groups. Results: Six FGDs were conducted with individuals with schizophrenia (n ​= ​11), their caregivers (n ​= ​14), and mental health clinicians (n ​= ​19). Four a priori themes were established: a) Prior experiences with health applications; b) Content of a mental health application; c) Involvement of caregivers in mental health application usage and d) Supporting doctors’ work through mental health applications. Additionally, two themes were generated inductively: a) Qualities of a mental health application and b) Data privacy and confidentiality. Conclusion: Exploration of stakeholder perspectives on the content, features, and uses of mental health applications is crucial to yield initial insights about the use of these digital programs in India. This study generated a multitude of suggestions on app functionality and components, which can guide ongoing efforts to develop and deliver digital mental health applications for patients living with schizophrenia in low-resource settings, with limited access to mental health services. © 2022 The Authors","Digital health; Global mental health; LMIC; Low-resource setting; Mental health; mHealth; Qualitative; Schizophrenia; Smartphone application","adult; aged; Article; audio recording; caregiver; clinical article; clinician; confidentiality; data privacy; female; health care need; human; India; information processing; male; outpatient department; personal experience; physician; schizophrenia; tertiary care center; triangulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146263069"

However, factors impacting user experiences and satisfaction levels across these platforms, using customer reviews, are still largely unexplored in academic research. The empirical framework we proposed in this paper addressed this research gap by analysing unmonitored user comments for some popular mHealth platforms. Using topic-modelling techniques, we identified the impacting factors (predictors) and categorised them into two major dimensions based on strategic adoption and motivational association. Findings from our study suggest that time and money, convenience, responsiveness, and availability emerge as significant predictors for delivering a positive user experience on m-health platforms. Next, we identified substantial moderating effects of review polarity on the predictors related to brand association and hedonic motivation, such as online booking and video consultation. Further, we also identified the top predictors for successful user experience across these platforms. Recommendations from our study will benefit business managers by offering an improved service design leading to higher user satisfaction across these m-health platforms. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Machine learning; Mobile health; Proportional-odds logit; Service-dominant logic; Text analytics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144032509"

Big data refer to complex datasets that are characterized by the attributes of “5 Vs”—variety, volume, velocity, veracity, and value. Big data analytics research has so far benefitted many fields of medicine, including ophthalmology. The availability of these big data not only allow for comprehensive and timely examinations of the epidemiology, trends, characteristics, outcomes, and prognostic factors of many diseases, but also enable the development of highly accurate AI algorithms in diagnosing a wide range of medical diseases as well as discovering new patterns or associations of diseases that are previously unknown to clinicians and researchers. Within the field of ophthalmology, there is a rapidly expanding pool of large clinical registries, epidemiological studies, omics studies, and biobanks through which big data can be accessed. National corneal transplant registries, genome-wide association studies, national cataract databases, and large ophthalmology-related EHR-based registries (e.g., AAO IRIS Registry) are some of the key resources. In this review, we aim to provide a succinct overview of the availability and clinical applicability of big data in ophthalmology, particularly from the perspective of corneal diseases and cataract, the synergistic potential of big data, AI technologies, internet of things, mHealth, and wearable smart devices, and the potential barriers for realizing the clinical and research potential of big data in this field.

Methods: We conducted a three-group, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (July 2019–June 2020) among pregnant women (aged 20–45 years, gestation <20 weeks, and no pre-existing diseases) attending the prenatal clinic of a tertiary care hospital in northern India. Participants were randomly assigned to three arms (Group 1, specially developed mobile application; Group 2, Whatsapp, and Group 3, Control—Standard of care) using block randomization. Blinding was not performed. The educational intervention (for Groups 1 and 2) included general details about pregnancy, self-care preventive practices, and self-management of minor illnesses during pregnancy. The control group received routine instructions delivered by the doctors as part of the standard of care. After 3 months, the post-intervention KAP assessment and satisfaction with interventions/care received were carried out. Results: Of the 150 pregnant women who participated (50 per group), 70 (46.6%) were graduates and 66 (44.0%) were primigravidas. Mean age was 28 years. Pregnant women in Groups 1 and 2 showed a statistically significant (P < 0.001) improvement in KAP on pregnancy self-care compared with the control group post-intervention. However, the same was insignificant (P > 0.05) between Groups 1 and 2. Participant satisfaction with the intervention was significantly high among Group 2 compared with the control group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: mHealth-based delivery of self-care education effectively improved KAP among pregnant women. The effectiveness of mHealth-based intervention must be assessed in primary healthcare settings before scaling up.

The internet of things (IoT) and many other mobile devices are another paradigm that has evolved lately and plays a significant role in communications. Smart healthcare has been a field of incredible change and growth in the age of smart houses, smart communities and the digital era. Technological expertise and electronics devices have fused, resulting in the internet of healthcare things (IoHT). It is considered to be one of the most required technological progress. However, the IoHT devices, wireless transmission of sensitive patient data poses some obvious security concerns. In addition, with the widespread use of IoHT devices, the foremost challenge is to manage and ensuring security while using IoHT for clinical applications. In this paper, the security and privacy challenges and associated threats in the domain of IoHT are thoroughly reviewed. A real-time collaborative jamming detection algorithm is proposed, which caters to all the significant challenges being faced. A jamming attack is a sub-type of denial of service (DoS) attack due to free Wi-Fi access points (APs) that executes on both mobile devices and Wi-Fi AP. The proposed algorithm investigates the strength of the received signal and the ratio of packet loss in the mobile devices, whereas the number of connected clients disrupted by the jammer is considered Wi-Fi AP. The approach aims to mitigate the causes of false alarms by connecting the originator present in the network, interfering with communication between the mobile devices and the Wi-Fi AP. This approach can be used to detect the presence of a jammer, which may hamper mobile device communication and prevent confidential information, that can be acquired via fake Wi-Fi AP. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","android security; healthcare IoT infrastructure jamming attack; mobile device privacy; mobile jamming; smartphone Wi-Fi","Android (operating system); Denial-of-service attack; Hospital data processing; Internet of things; mHealth; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Access points; Android securities; Healthcare internet of thing infrastructure jamming attack; Jammers; Jamming attacks; Mobile device privacy; Mobile jamming; Security vulnerabilities; Smart phones; Smartphone wi-fi; Jamming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117947783"

Further, to develop models using these feature variables to predict if anybody is having a mental health issue or not. Independent-samples t-test has been used to compare the variation in means between the healthy group and group with mental illness. Correlation analysis is used to see the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The classification model has been developed to predict mental health, (baseline: n = 45). The difference in means of various feature variables among the two groups is statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). Many variables are strongly correlated with various mental health predictors. The area under curve of the prediction model for predicting stress is 82.6% and that for the depression is 74%. Our results are quite encouraging and point towards the novel application of smartphone-based data sensing in tracking or predicting mental health issues. The study has some implications for practice such as developing a smartphone-based automated system for predicting mental health that could be a useful tool for professionals in predicting mental health, especially in academic institutions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","eHealth; Mental health; mHealth; Pervasive computing; Predictive modeling; Smartphone","Automation; Diseases; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Academic institutions; Automated systems; Classification models; Correlation analysis; Dependent variables; Independent samples t tests; Novel applications; Research problems; Smartphones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094867379"

Such analysis and estimations can be done accurately only on high quality PPG signals with very minimal artifacts. PPG signals collected from fitness grade and smart phone scenarios are prone to muscle artifacts and hence there is a need to assess the signal quality before using the signal. Although there are approaches available in the realm of machine learning and deep learning, they are computationally expensive and may not be suitable for a wearable or edge computing scenario. In this paper, we propose the design of a quality checker to check the quality of the signal that can be directly implemented on edge devices like smartwatch. The algorithm is tested on PPG data collected from wearable, ICU and medical grade devices. In the wearable scenario where the noise levels are very high, our algorithm has performed significantly better with a Fscore of over 0.92.

The army, navy, and air force are primarily responsible for national security (air). Soldiers have an important role in maintaining national security. Many people are worried about the soldiers' safety. For a country's security to be ensured, its military department must be effective. Soldiers who are on a mission or doing special operations will benefit from this technology. The soldiers' location, health, and other factors would be tracked via GPS (Global Positioning Systems). For continuous remote monitoring of troops' health, M-health technologies such as mobile computers, medical sensors, and communication technologies are employed. Smart sensors such as heart rate sensor, temperature sensor are attached along with bomb detector and panic button to the suggested system in which the complete mobility is to be implemented via a personal server. The parameters collected by the real time sensors attached are sent to the processor for further processing. The noise free signal is an important metric in this application; this would be carried out by edge computing solutions by the nearby personal server. The data will be sent by wireless connection to the base station which is located far away from the sensing location. Each soldier is also equipped with an ESP32 module that allows them to communicate with the base station in the event of an injury. Furthermore, once a soldier enters enemy territory, it is extremely difficult for the army base station to keep track of their whereabouts and health status. The tracking of soldiers as well as their health status during the fight will be forecasted in this study, and appropriate steps will be made by developing a mobile app which would provide an immediate alert to the people in the base station as well as nearby locality troops. © 2022 IEEE.","ESP32 Module; GPS Tracking; M-Health; Nations Security","Base stations; Internet of things; mHealth; National security; ESP32 module; Global positioning system tracking; Health status; Healthcare monitoring; M-health; Monitoring and tracking; Monitoring system; Nation security; System tracking; Tracking system; Global positioning system","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129215094"

With advancement in technology and production of compact and portable sensors, there have been attempts to use new technologies in multiple domains to improve human quality life. The health-care industry is one of the key areas of research where the technology has been adopted. IoT principles have been widely employed to connect existing medical resources and provide patients with smart, dependable, and effective healthcare services. In this paper have made an attempt to present an IoT architecture customized for healthcare applications. The prevalent healthcare model is mostly in-hospital based and includes periodic visits that might prove to be strenuous to patients. The aim of this work is to present a remote healthcare monitoring system especially for older and Chronic Heart Failure(CHF) patients to daily collect vital signs at home and send them using Internet of Things (IoT) and is later stored in the cloud using ThingSpeak. This allows the doctor to keep an eye on the patient from afar and take timely action if necessary. In the process we have identified a set of four parameters, i.e. Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Pulse rate, Temperature and Position detection by using wearable sensors. These sensors are connected to a Raspberry Pi. The microcontroller acts as a server once it gets connected to internet and sends data to ThingSpeak cloud.

Telecommunication makes it possible with electronic devices and their tools. The scientist Alexander Graham Bell has invented the basic telephone in 1876 in the USA. Telephones now have the new format in the form of mobile phones, which are the primary media for communicating and transmitting data. We are using 5th-generation mobile network standards. Still, there are some requirements for the users that are believed to be solved in the 6th-generation mobile network standards. By 2030, all of the people would be using 6G. The computing model in the cloud is not dependent on either the location or any specific device that would provide the service. It is an on-demand computational service-oriented mechanism. Combining these two technologies as mobile cloud computing provides customized options with more flexible implementations. Artificial intelligence is being used in devices in many fields. AI can be used in mobile network services (MNS) to provide more reliable and customized services to the users, such as network operation monitoring, network operation management, fraud detection, and reduction in mobile transactions and security to the cyber devices. Combining cloud with AI in mobile network services in the 6th generation would improve human beings' lives, such as zero road accidents, advanced level special health care, and zero crime rates in society. However, the most vital needs for sixth-generation standards are the capability to manage large volumes of records and excessive-statistics-fee connectivity in step with gadgets. The sixth-generation mobile network is under development. This generation has many exciting features. Security is the central issue that needs to be sorted out using appropriate forensic mechanisms. There is a need to approach high-performance computing for improved services to the end-user. Considering three-dimensional research methodologies (technical dimension, organizational dimension, and applications hosted on the cloud) in a high-performance computing environment leads to two different cases such as real-time stream processing and remote desktop connection and performance test. By 'narrowing the targeted worldwide audience with a wide range of experiential opportunities,' this paper is aimed at delivering dynamic and varied resource allocation for reliable and justified on-demand services.  © 2022 Srinivasa Rao Gundu et al.","","Cellular telephones; Cloud security; Crime; Cybersecurity; mHealth; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; AI systems; Cloud securities; Mobile clouds; Network operations; Network standards; Networks services; Performance computing; Privacy risks; Security and privacy; Security risks; Wireless networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130357912"

Objectives: This study aimed to design a mobile phone application (app) to enable or improve communication between family caregivers, community caregivers, and palliative care teams; to evaluate its acceptability, processes, and mechanisms of action; and to propose refinements. Methods: A codesign process entailed collaboration between a Project Advisory Group and collaborators in India, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. We then trained community and family caregivers to use an app to communicate patient-reported outcomes to their palliative care providers each week on a data dashboard. App activity was monitored, and qualitative in-depth interviews explored experience with the app and its mechanisms and impact. Results: N = 149 caregivers participated and uploaded n = 837 assessments of patient-reported outcomes. These data were displayed to the palliative care team on an outcomes dashboard on n = 355 occasions. Qualitative data identified: 1) high acceptability and data usage; 2) improved understanding by team members of patient symptoms and concerns; 3) a need for better feedback to caregivers, for better prioritisation of patients according to need, for enhanced training and support to use the app, and for user-led recommendations for ongoing improvement. Conclusion: An outcomes-focused app and data dashboard are acceptable to caregivers and health-care professionals. They are beneficial in identifying, monitoring, and communicating patient outcomes and in allocating staff resource to those most in need. © 2020 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","community health worker; global health; low income country; Mobile health; palliative care","Cell Phone; Humans; India; Mobile Applications; Palliative Care; Uganda; Zimbabwe; adult; aged; Article; caregiver; community; evaluation study; female; global health; health auxiliary; health care need; health care personnel; home care; human; India; interpersonal communication; interview; low income country; male; monitoring; palliative therapy; patient-reported outcome; pilot study; qualitative research; software design; symptom; Uganda; Zimbabwe; mobile application; mobile phone; palliative therapy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109083299"

The review article is based on the utilization of the mobile phones in the form of text information, image sharing, video call, doctor appointment, and auto-generated schedule during the global pandemics situations. Initially the motivation behind the technology was the availability of physical and psychological care for unreached communities. But, in the situation of pandemics, there is a high momentum to the mHealth application in the healthcare delivery system. The differential utilization of cell phone has led to the multiplication of health-related personalized applications day by day for the human race; there are numerous expected roads for mHealth to be fill in as an aide instrument to general health care when most of the developed and developing nations are in a cyclic process of lockdown of the century. In the present times, people are advised by the WHO to make a physical distance from everyone; hence the mHealth promptly came into existence with its importance. However, there are both pros and cons of every technology; here mHealth helps to provide improved treatment availability due to its promptness, ease, accessibility but on the another hand, there is the limitation of mHealth applications as personal data sharing with the network providers is easier. There are concerns like moral, legitimate, and clinical issues identified with mHealth usage, incorporating issues with information security, protection issues with limits, and interjurisdictional practice concerns. The technology-centric model launching incorporates the traditional medical approaches and training through the emerging technology-centric model into medical and educational systems to support medical practitioners and the patients. The review article presents the proof for the focal points and impediments of rebuilding a medicinal service framework on essential considerations. It depends on a fast, however, orderly audit of critical sources of strewn writing. The results are unpredictable for various reasons, including varying meanings of administrations, staff and the limits among essential and auxiliary consideration, changing hierarchical structures, and expanding dependence on essential consideration groups for mHealth. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives: To develop a mobile application for OSA-risk assessment and tests its validity, feasibility, and application in a hospital-based pilot sample. Study design and methods: The study comprised of two parts. Part i: Development of a mobile application “OSA-Risk Assessment Tool” using automated questionnaires. Part ii: A pilot study to screen OSA-risk in 200 patients (100 adults,100 children) from the orthodontic OPD of a Govt. Dental Hospital, using the mobile application. Internal validation by manual and mobile-based methods was done on 30 random patients. Non-parametric tests assessed the statistical differences between OSA-risk and nonOSA-risk variables. Results: The prevalence of OSA-risk was 21.4% in adults and 8% in children. In adults, OSA-risk showed significantly greater neck circumference (p = 0.0001), waist circumference(p = 0.001), body mass index(p = 0.008), daytime sleepiness, headache, and mouth breathing(p = 0.0001). In children, OSA-risk is associated with a dry mouth on awakening, daytime sleepiness, and mouth breathing, and nocturnal enuresis. The low OSA-risk patients were suggested standardized preventive management counseling and orthodontic interventions while medium to high-risk underwent sleep-specialist referrals. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility and usability of the mobile application “OSA-risk assessment tool” in a hospital setup. This cost-effective tool can be advocated for self-evaluation, early detection, and awareness in pandemic times. The future upgraded versions may include preventive modules and real-time coordination with the nearest sleep clinics and specialists. © 2021","mHealth; Mobile application; Obstructive sleep apnea; OSA; Questionnaire; Technological innovations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119048537"

We developed a mobile application (M-OncoED) to educate physicians on cancer screening and tested the acceptability, utility, and cost of two different approaches to recruit physicians. Methods: M-OncoED was designed to perform pre- and postlearning assessments through the in-built quizzes; present case studies and educational materials for cervical, breast, and oral cancer screening; collect responses to interactive queries; document module completion; send reminders and alerts; and track user metrics, including number of sessions to complete each module and time spent per session. We tested two recruitment approaches: a broad-scale recruitment group, for which we relied on e-mails, messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp), and phone calls, and the targeted recruitment group, for which we conducted a face-to-face meeting for the initial invitation. Results: Overall, about 35% of those invited in the targeted group completed the course compared with about 3% in the broad-based recruitment group. The targeted recruitment approach was more cost-efficient ($55.33 vs. $109.43 per person). Cervical cancer screening knowledge increased by about 30 percentage points, and breast cancer screening knowledge increased by 10 percentage points. There was no change in knowledge for oral cancer scorings. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of using an mHealth app to educate physicians. A more intensive hands-on recruitment approach is likely required to engage physicians to download and complete the app. Future studies should assess the impact of mHealth tools on physician behavior and patient outcomes. Implications for Practice: Mobile health (mHealth)–based oncology education can be a powerful tool for providing cancer screening knowledge to physicians, as mobile technology is widely available and inexpensive. This study has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of using an mHealth app to educate physicians and illustrates the type of recruitment approach (face-to-face) that is likely required to incentivize physicians to download the app and complete the training. © 2021 The Authors.

Mini sensor systems and smart access points are heavily involved to use the surrounding atmosphere data. In all industrial Internet of Things, it has been used to remotely capture and interpret real-time data. Since the Interoperable ecosystem collects and discloses data via unsecure government networks, an effective Encryption and Schlissel Agreement approach to avoid un authorized access is preferred. The Internet of Medical Stuff has grown into an expert technology infrastructure in the medical industry. The clinical symptoms of patients are obtained and analyzed. The clinical smart objects, incorporated in the human chest, must be studied functionally. In exchange, it will use smart mobile devices to provide the patient medical records. Although the data obtained by patients is so delicate that it is not a medical profession, the safety and protection of medical data becomes a problem for the IoM. Thus, a user authentication protocol based on anonymity is chosen to solve problems in IoM about the security of privacy. A reliable and transparent facial recognition user identification scheme is introduced in this paper in order to ensure safe contact in smart healthcare. This report also indicates that a competitor cannot unlawfully view or remove the intelligent handheld card as a lawful user. A comprehensive review on the basis of the model of random oracles and resource analysis is given to illustrate medical applications’ security and resource performance. Moreover, the proposed schema foresees that it has high-safety characteristics to develop intelligent IoM health application systems as a result of the performance review.

The usage of IoT devices such as smart wearables, smart phones, smart cities are increasing in the linear scale. Health care is one of the primary applications today that uses IoT devices. Data generated in this application may need computation, storage and data analytics operations which requires resourceful environment for remote patient health monitoring. The data related with health care applications are primarily private and should be readily available to the users. Enforcing these two constraints in cloud environment is a hard task. Fog computing is an emergent architecture for providing computation, storage, control and network services within user’s proximity. To handle private data, the processing elements should be trustable entities in Fog environment. In this paper we propose novel Trust Enforced computation ofFLoading technique for trust worthy applications using fOg computiNg (TEFLON). The proposed system comprises of two algorithms namely optimal service offloader and trust assessment for addressing security and trust issues with reduced response time. And the simulation results show that proposed TEFLON framework improves success rate of fog collaboration with reduced average latency for delay sensitive applications and ensures trust for trustworthy applications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computational offloading; Fog computing; Health care; Response time; Trusted node identification","Data Analytics; Digital storage; Fog; Internet of things; mHealth; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Remote patient monitoring; Smartphones; Storage as a service (STaaS); Trusted computing; Cloud environments; Computation offloading; Delay-sensitive applications; Health care application; Internet of Things (IOT); Processing elements; Security and trusts; Trust assessments; Fog computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103648354"

Improving care for young children is now considered fundamental to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. With support from WHO and Intervida (an international non-governmental organization), implementation on care for early childhood development was carried out by Survival for Women and Children Foundation in 100 villages in Haryana, India. In addition to the implementation of evidence-based interventions, mHealth (phone message (SMS) and phone call) was used as a complementary strategy. The intention was to promote self-care, increase coverage, and improve inter-sectoral collaboration. One message per day was developed (915 messages) and 1564630 SMS were sent to all beneficiaries and providers to facilitate interaction. Based on learnings, the consolidation of this approach into 46 core themes helped to refine interactions. Lot Quality Assurance Sampling was used for evaluation. SMS was received, read and practiced by the caregivers and the care providers in the intervention block, being substantially higher than in the control blocks. There was a remarkable improvement in under-nutrition and wasting; however, the reduction in stunting was modest in the intervention area as compared with two control blocks. This is attributed to implementation of all strategies in the project including the complementary approach of use of mHealth. The application of SMS and phone communication continues to have relevance, since people most in need are poor and require integrated package of services maximally during this crucial period for improving equity and coverage. © 2021, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.","Continuum of care; e-health; Integrated approach; Inter-sectoral collaboration; Self-care","Child; Child, Preschool; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; India; Lot Quality Assurance Sampling; Pregnancy; Self Care; Telemedicine; Article; cell phone use; child; child development; childhood; controlled study; female; Haryana; health care planning; human; lot quality assurance sampling; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; methodology; stunting; telehealth; text messaging; wasting syndrome; health care delivery; India; lot quality assurance sampling; pregnancy; preschool child; self care; telemedicine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119527518"

It can be done effectively using innovative methods like mobile health (mHealth), which includes mobile applications, phone calls, and text messages. Thus, this meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for the management of diabetes compared with usual care in the Asian population. Materials and Methods: Searches were performed in electronic databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library, in August and September 2020. Search terms used were ""Diabetes Mellitus,"" ""mHealth,"" ""glycemic control"", ""HbA1c levels,"" and ""Blood glucose levels."" The primary outcome was glycated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels. Trials were pooled, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 statistic. Results: The search yielded 3980 abstracts, of which 18 trials met the inclusion criteria. Lowering of Hba1c levels was reported in the majority of trials, which aided in Glycemic control. For post prandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels, a statistically significant reduction of value -20.13 (95%CI -35.16 to -5.10, P = 0.009, I 2 = 59%) was seen in the mean in the intervention group, whereas for HbA1c levels the mean reduction in the intervention group was -0.44 (95%CI, -0.79 to 0.10, P = 0.01, I 2 = 87%). Although these interventions proved beneficial for these outcomes, there was a difference in the amount of effects caused by different mHealth interventions. Conclusion: This study acknowledged the effects of different mHealth interventions as per their accessibility and availability in recent years. There is a need to include more studies in future reviews to generate a larger body of evidence for the reported outcomes. The researchers should give the utmost priority to the transparency while reporting the interventions for effective interpretation of the retrieved data. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

This method of operation for curing the health-related issues and other problems using technology has not changed till today. With a growing number of new inventions, the utilization of technology for health issues has grown; especially the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has grown a lot. As the utilization of IoT technology has increased in health and related issues, new opportunities have also risen. Some of the advanced features like the utilization of the sensors and biosensors with the combination of big data models have grown a lot. With the utilization of big data and its allied areas in the health issues, solutions have been found for some of the problems like the handling of huge amount of patient data and different types of data like the static and dynamic types of data with heterogeneous datasets. With the utilization of IoT and big data in the health-related areas, it has given birth to different types of medical applications to be developed and being used in various sectors of the country. The development of new technologies like ehealth and mhealth (stands for mobile health) is playing a key role in providing medical services to every corner or the remote locations of the country. The IoT has given even the big applications-based services to the public like the accessibility of the health-related services to the common public in villages; the treatment to be delivered to a patient is tailored to meet the patient’s condition. The people who had invested huge sums of money in establishing these technologies also got good returns, more than the expected amounts. Today the IoT has broadened its areas of implementation and the amounts of services being served to the various people located at different locations of the nation. The ehealth services have extended almost to every corner of the country though still some problems exist. Some of the major needs of this technology to reach every common man are the provision of reliable services in health, appropriate services, and also the safe and less power consumption-based services are to be made available. The provision of these services will address several problems and their related issues with many medical requests and demands being made by several customers located at various locations. The best way of providing such quality and refined services to the customers or the patients is through the collaborative work done by both the hardware and the software services. In such cases, the technology can be improved furthermore and can be moved further to the next level of inventions. Some of the advancements should take place in some areas like the networks, software, electronics, sensors, biosensors, data recognition, data analytics, cloud models, cloud computing, big data applications, big data analysis, information technology improvements for the better improvement and for better services to be delivered to the patients at various locations of the nation in a fast and effective manner. The research and its ramifications in healthcare have led to the evolution of many medical areas of applications utilization. Several new areas of technology have grown like the computer science engineering, medical engineering, genetic engineering, biomedical applications, applications in medicine, big data analytics, and related areas in health-related sectors. The scientists in biomedical engineering work on the biosensors and fluids at micro levels to develop new tools in medical areas. Similarly the computer scientist works and analyses the behavior of the diseases, infections, and their predictions based on various symptoms with the help of artificial intelligence and related application-based areas. By considering the several factors and points discussed above, it is clear that several gaps have been observed, and these gaps can be covered or filled with various technological advancements and new adaptive frameworks to be developed further. These sort of frameworks should be in such a way that these models should communicate between the gaps that were being identified between the technologies available. The best model in this was to create a common cybermodel with the combination of other systems such that all the various modes can be brought under a common umbrella of technologies like the physical and other modes of communications. With this model, all the healthcare and technologies will be brought near such that to provide the services in common way with common platform. In the current chapter, a detailed discussion about the IoT and its applications and about the big data and its applications are discussed in detail. A detailed discussion and analysis will be provided about the challenges that were being faced by the users and the developers when these technologies are being used for the development and working of various medical-related applications and their related fields. When a greater number of systems which belongs to various applications and fields were gathered together to solve or to simplify the problems and challenges in the medical applications, various issues and other related problems and the probable solutions to such problems are discussed in detail. The impact of these technologies on various applications, and their advancements, especially on complex systems also are discussed in detail. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The impacts of COVID-19 is a matter of grave concern in terms of fatality rate, socio-economical condition, health infrastructure. It is obvious that only pharmaceutical solutions (vaccine) cannot eradicate this pandemic completely, and effective strategies regarding lockdown measures, restricted mobility, emergency services to users—in brief data-driven decision system is of utmost importance. This necessitates an efficient data analytics framework, data infrastructure to store, manage pandemic related information, and distributed computing platform to support such data-driven operations. In the past few decades, Internet of Things-based devices and applications have emerged significantly in various sectors including healthcare and time-critical applications. To be specific, health-sensors help to accumulate health-related parameters at different time-instances of a day, the movement sensors keep track of mobility traces of the user, and helps to assist them in varied conditions. The smartphones are equipped with several such sensors and the ability of low-cost connected sensors to cover large areas makes it the most useful component to combat pandemics such as COVID-19. However, analysing and managing the huge amount of data generated by these sensors is a big challenge. In this paper we have proposed a unified framework which has three major components: (i) Spatial Data Infrastructure to manage, store, analyse and share spatio-temporal information with stakeholders efficiently, (ii) Cloud–Fog–Edge-based hierarchical architecture to support preliminary diagnosis, monitoring patients’ mobility, health parameters and activities while they are in quarantine or home-based treatment, and (iii) Assisting users in varied emergency situation leveraging efficient data-driven techniques at low-latency and energy consumption. The mobility data analytics along with SDI is required to interpret the movement dynamics of the region and correlate with COVID-19 hotspots. Further, Cloud–Fog–Edge-based system architecture is required to provision healthcare services efficiently and in timely manner. The proposed framework yields encouraging results in taking decisions based on the COVID-19 context and assisting users effectively by enhancing accuracy of detecting suspected infected people by ∼ 24% and reducing delay by ∼ 55% compared to cloud-only system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cloud–Fog–Edge framework; COVID-19; Health data analysis; Health service provisioning","Coronavirus; Diagnosis; Edge computing; Emergency services; Energy utilization; Fog; Fog computing; Information management; mHealth; Patient treatment; Cloud–fog–edge framework; Condition; COVID-19; Data analytics; Edge computing; Health data analyse; Health service provisioning; Health services; Service provisioning; Spatial data infrastructure; Data Analytics","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131324952"

An multiple feature extraction algorithms were employed such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract the feature from EEG data. The dimension of the feature space was reduced by employing linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The normalized features were passed through diverse nature of multiple classifiers, namely, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and convolution neural network (CNN) to perform classification analysis.

SOD is highly useful in defense, military, surveillance, medical, industrial and analysis in sports applications. Various algorithms were developed in the past to solve the problem of SOD. However, the algorithms developed are not suitable for real-time applications. In this work, a convolutional neural network architecture based on YOLO is proposed to enhance small objects' detection performance. The proposed network is inspired by the ideas of Residual blocks, Densenet, Feature Pyramidal Network, Cross stage partial connections, and 1 × 1 convolutions. The Receptive field and the reuse of feature maps are the main factors in the design of the architecture and is hence referred to as RFSOD. It is developed as a lightweight network to suit real-time applications and can run smoothly on single-board computers such as Jetson Nano, Tx2, Raspberry Pi and the like. The proposed model is evaluated on various public datasets such as VHR10, BCCD dataset and few small-size objects from the MS COCO dataset. This work is motivated by the need to develop a vision system for a badminton-playing robot. Therefore, the proposed model is also tested on a custom-made shuttlecock dataset. The model's performance is compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning models that are suitable for real-time applications. The hardware implementation of the proposed model was carried out on Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi4 and a Laptop with an i5 processor. Improved Detection accuracy was observed on small objects. More than 2 × detection speed was obtained on Raspberry Pi, and i5 processor while 30% improvement was observed on Jetson Nano with real-time videos. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning architecture; Lightweight architecture; Object detection and tracking; Small object detection; YOLO","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; mHealth; Military applications; Network architecture; Sports; Computer vision applications; Detection accuracy; Detection performance; Embedded application; Hardware implementations; Real-time application; Single board computers; Sports applications; Object detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115270097"

It has widespread applications in various fields such as sports, healthcare, criminal investigation and so on. With the advent of smart devices like smartphones, availability of inertial sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope can easily be used to track our daily physical movements. State-of-the-art deep neural network models like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) do not need any additional feature extraction for such applications. However, it requires huge amount of data for training which is time consuming, and requires ample resource. Another limiting factor of CNN is that it considers only the features of an individual sample for learning without considering any structural information among the samples. To address the aforesaid issues, we propose an end-to-end fast Graph Neural Network (GNN) which not only captures the individual sample information efficiently but also the relationship with other samples in the form of an undirected graph structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work where the time series data are transformed into a structural representation of graph for the purpose of HAR using sensor data. Proposed model has been evaluated on 6 publicly available datasets, and it achieves nearly 100% recognition accuracy for all the 6 datasets.

In addition, smart phones are widely used for taking screen shots so important information can be saved. Image-based Text Extraction has a growing requirement in today's generation. Educational organizations, medical and banking, engineering sectors generate lot of images every day. It is essential to extract text from these images in a simple yet effective manner. Text Extraction involves a lot of processes such as text detection, localization, segmentation and, text recognition. The Optical character Recognition (OCR) System involves several algorithms that fulfill this purpose. Tesseract is the one of the OCR Engine build by HP Labs and owned by Google. Google's ML kit is also one of the optimized technology build and owned by Google and It provide methods for easy text extraction. Once the text is extracted it can be translated using different API's available for Language translation. Google translate API is the most popular and accurate technology so far. Also, many mobile applications are available to translate from English to other languages and vice versa. The Proposed system aims to detect, recognize and extract the text from images with plain white as well as color and complex background. It uses Machine Learning technology to extract text from image and then translate it into available set of languages. This application can be useful to overcome the language barrier among tourists, who are visiting other countries. So, by using this application they can get the right information wherever it is needed and it will make communication more easier. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2022.","cross-platform development; firebase; flutter; image; ML-kit; Mobile application; scan; Text-extraction; text-recognition; translation","Medical imaging; mHealth; Mobile computing; Optical character recognition; Smartphones; Translation (languages); Cross platform development; Firebase; Flutter; Image; ML-kit; Mobile applications; Scan; Text extraction; Text recognition; Translation; Extraction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143298921"

Looking into the present doctor-to‐patient ratio in our country (1:1700 as per a Times of India report in 2021), it is very essential to develop self‐management mHealth applications. Thus, there is a need to ensure simple and user-friendly mHealth applications to improve customer satisfaction. The goal of this study is to assess and appraise the usability and effectiveness of existing T2DM‐focused mHealth applications. TOP‐ SIS, VIKOR, and PROMETHEE II are three multi‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) approaches considered in the proposed work for the evaluation of the usability of five existing T2DM mHealth applications, which include Glucose Buddy, mySugr, Diabetes: M, Blood Glucose Tracker, and OneTouch Reveal. The methodology used in the research work is a questionnaire‐based evaluation that focuses on certain attributes and sub‐attributes, identified based on the features of mHealth applications. CRITIC methodology is used for obtaining the attribute weights, which give the pri-ority of the attributes. The resulting analysis signifies our proposed research by ranking the mHealth applications based on usability and customer satisfaction. © 2021 by the authors.

We present the design and validation of a non-invasive smart-phone based screening tool for atherosclerosis and coronary arterial disease (CAD), which is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Approach. We designed a three-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) device that connects to a smart phone application for measuring pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) using PPG probes that are simultaneously clipped onto to the ear, index finger, and big toe, respectively. Validation was performed through a clinical study with 100 participants (age 20 to 77) at a research hospital in Nagpur, India. Study subjects were stratified by age and divided into three groups corresponding to the disease severity: CAD, hypertensive ('Pre-CAD'), and Healthy. Main results. PWV measurements derived from the Ear-Toe probe measurements yielded the best performance, with median PWV values increasing monotonically as a function of disease severity and age, as follows: 14.2 m s-1 for the older-patient CAD group, 12.2 m s-1 for the younger-patient CAD group, 11.6 m s-1 for the older-patient Pre-CAD group, 10.2 m s-1 for the younger-patient Pre-CAD group, 9.7 m s-1 for the older healthy controls, and 8.4 m s-1 for the younger healthy controls. Using just two simple features, the PTT and patient height, we demonstrate a machine learning prediction model for CAD with a median accuracy of 0.83 (AUC). Significance. This work demonstrates the ability to predict atherosclerosis and CAD using a single simple physiological measurement with a multi-site PPG tool that is electrically powered by a mobile phone and does not require any electrocardiogram reference. Furthermore, this method only requires a single anthropometric measurement, which is the patient's height.  © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","atherosclerosis; cardiovascular; coronary arterial disease; diagnosis; mHealth; photoplethysmography; pulse wave velocity","Adult; Aged; Atherosclerosis; Coronary Artery Disease; Electrocardiography; Humans; Middle Aged; Photoplethysmography; Pulse Wave Analysis; Young Adult; Blood; Cardiology; Clinical research; Diseases; mHealth; Photoplethysmography; Probes; Smartphones; Wave propagation; Arterial disease; Cardiovascular; Coronary arterial disease; Disease severity; Healthy controls; Multi-site; Pulse transit time; Pulse-wave velocity; Screening tool; Simple++; adult; aged; atherosclerosis; coronary artery disease; electrocardiography; human; middle aged; photoelectric plethysmography; pulse wave; young adult; Acoustic wave velocity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111209155"

A difficult endeavor, the prognosis of cardiovascular disease survival is important in assisting medical practitioners in making the best judgments possible for their individuals. Patients with heart failure need the knowledge and skill of health doctors to be properly cared for. The use of machine learning techniques may aid in the comprehension of the signs of cardiovascular disease. Hand - crafted feature development, on the other hand, is difficult and necessitates the use of specialized knowledge to determine the most suited approach. This research presents a smart health monitoring structure that makes use of the Internet of Things and cloud mechanism to enhance the mortality forecast of patients with chronic heart failure with no need for human classifier, as previously done. In addition, the smart IoT-based infrastructure analyzes individuals just on based entirely information and offers cardiac rehabilitation with fast, efficient, and high-quality medical care. Additionally, the suggested model analyses whether deep learning models are effective in distinguishing between heart failure patients who are alive and those who are died. The framework makes use of Internet of Things-based sensors to collect signals and transmit them to a cloud web application for analysis. Learning algorithms are used to further analyse these data in order to identify the condition of the patients. Health information and process monitoring are communicated with a medical expert who will respond to the patient in the event that emergency assistance is necessary.

Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) thus combines mobile computing and Cloud Computing (CC) in order to use offloading techniques to expand mobile computer capabilities. Computer offloading solves Smart Mobile Devices (SMD) limitations such as limited computing power, limited battery life and limited storage space by distributing output and workload to other rich systems with enhanced efficiency and resources. For data modelling and analysis, scientific research also needs a large amount of computing power. This paper explains about the donation of processing power from unused smartphone computing power to the mobiles that need to download projects of medicine, astronomy, geology and physics through mobile web services. This is accomplished by developing a cellular gadget called 'Power Save' that download and coordinate the projects to be downloaded during the dormant condition of the mobile. Once the project is downloaded, the status of project server is changed and a new task is assigned. This gadget-based processing power sharing would be assistive in saving mobile's battery life and performance level of CPU.

Physiotherapists rely on the patient’s self-reporting to collect the essential information, subsequently transcribed into a paper format. While paper-based techniques are helpful, they have drawbacks, requiring patients to recall their pain episodes retrospectively. As a result, the information reported may be incorrect. Such issues can be avoided with mobile phone applications. However, studies on similar technologies revealed a lack of user, clinician, or healthcare-system involvement in their development and little study on their efficacy. An issue that has been highlighted in numerous studies is the lack of healthcare professionals’ involvement in designing and creating the application for pain recording. Furthermore, none of the already existing applications has been tested for their validity, reliability, usability, etc. This paper aims to see if a newly developed application is valid and reliable.

Roadmaps provide a blueprint for implementation of priority solutions for the principal cardiovascular diseases leading to death and disability. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of these conditions and is an increasing problem due to ageing of the world’s population and an increase in cardiovascular risk factors that predispose to AF. The goal of the AF roadmap was to provide guidance on priority interventions that are feasible in multiple countries, and to identify roadblocks and potential strategies to overcome them. Since publication of the AF Roadmap in 2017, there have been many technological advances including devices and artificial intelligence for identification and prediction of unknown AF, better methods to achieve rhythm control, and widespread uptake of smartphones and apps that could facilitate new approaches to healthcare delivery and increasing community AF awareness. In addition, the World Health Organisation added the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the Essential Medicines List, making it possible to increase advocacy for their widespread adoption as therapy to prevent stroke. These advances motivated the WHF to commission a 2020 AF Roadmap update. Three years after the original Roadmap publication, the identified barriers and solutions were judged still relevant, and progress has been slow. This 2020 Roadmap update reviews the significant changes since 2017 and identifies priority areas for achieving the goals of reducing death and disability related to AF, particularly targeted at low-middle income countries. These include advocacy to increase appreciation of the scope of the problem; plugging gaps in guideline management and prevention through physician education, increasing patient health literacy, and novel ways to increase access to integrated healthcare including mHealth and digital transformations; and greater emphasis on achieving practical solutions to national and regional entrenched barriers. Despite the advances reviewed in this update, the task will not be easy, but the health rewards of implementing solutions that are both innovative and practical will be great. © 2021 The Author(s).","AF; Atrial fibrillation; Cardiology; Digital technology; NOACs; WHF","Administration, Oral; Anticoagulants; Artificial Intelligence; Atrial Fibrillation; Humans; Stroke; antiarrhythmic agent; anticoagulant agent; anticoagulant agent; anticoagulant therapy; artificial intelligence; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; cognitive defect; dementia; digital technology; embolism; global disease burden; health care access; health care planning; health literacy; heart atrium appendage; heart failure; heart protection; heart rate variability; heart rhythm; human; interventional cardiovascular procedure; intracardiac thrombosis; knowledge; left atrial appendage occlusion; medical education; medication compliance; mobile application; nurse; patient advocacy; patient compliance; patient education; patient monitoring; physician; physician assistant; primary prevention; primordial prevention; Review; screening test; social support; transitional care; World Health Organization; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; oral drug administration","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108100126"

Blending Artificial Intelligence (AI) with chest X-ray images and incorporating these models in a smartphone can be handy for the accelerated diagnosis of COVID-19. In this study, publicly available datasets of chest X-ray images have been utilized for training and testing of five pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models namely VGG16, MobileNetV2, Xception, NASNetMobile and InceptionResNetV2. Prior to the training of the selected models, the number of images in COVID-19 category has been increased employing traditional augmentation and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The performance of the five pre-trained CNN models utilizing the images generated with the two strategies has been compared. In the case of models trained using augmented images, Xception (98%) and MobileNetV2 (97.9%) turned out to be the ones with highest validation accuracy. Xception (98.1%) and VGG16 (98.6%) emerged as models with the highest validation accuracy in the models trained with synthetic GAN images. The best performing models have been further deployed in a smartphone and evaluated. The overall results suggest that VGG16 and Xception, trained with the synthetic images created using GAN, performed better compared to models trained with augmented images. Among these two models VGG16 produced an encouraging Diagnostic Odd Ratio (DOR) with higher positive likelihood and lower negative likelihood for the prediction of COVID-19. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chest X-rays; Convolutional Neural Network; COVID-19; Deep learning; GAN; Smartphone application","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; mHealth; Smartphones; Adversarial networks; Chest X-ray; Chest X-ray image; Convolutional neural network; COVID-19; Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Neural network modelling; Smart phones; Smart-phone applications; Diagnosis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108092933"

This study aims to understand the uptake of ASMAN application (defined as completeness of electronic case sheets), the role of CDSS in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery outcomes. Methods: We have conducted secondary analysis of program data (government data) collected from 81 public facilities across four districts each in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The data collected between August –October 2017 (baseline) and the data collected between December 2019 – March 2020 (latest) was analysed. The data sources included: digitized labour room registers, case sheets, referral and discharge summary forms, observation checklist and complication format. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate and interrupted time series regression analyses were conducted. Results: The completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period (40.5%), and in facilities with more than 300 deliveries a month (20.9%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the introduction of technology yielded significant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices. We have observed reduction in fresh still births rates and asphyxia, but these results were not statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis. However, our analysis showed that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased. Conclusions: Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care and delivery outcome. Future studies with rigorous study design is required to understand the impact of technology in improving quality of maternity care. © 2021, The Author(s).","CDSS; Health information technology; Intrapartum care; Maternal health; mHealth; New-born health; Postpartum care; Quality improvement","Asphyxia Neonatorum; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Female; Guideline Adherence; Health Plan Implementation; Humans; India; Infant, Newborn; Obstetric Labor Complications; Perinatal Care; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Pregnancy; Program Evaluation; Quality Improvement; Stillbirth; Article; clinical decision support system; controlled study; eclampsia; female; health care availability; health care delivery; health care facility; health care quality; human; India; intrapartum care; multivariate logistic regression analysis; perinatal asphyxia; postpartum hemorrhage; preeclampsia; protocol compliance; puerperium; stillbirth; technology; clinical decision support system; clinical practice; clinical trial; electronic health record; health care planning; labor complication; multicenter study; newborn; newborn hypoxia; organization and management; perinatal care; practice guideline; pregnancy; program evaluation; total quality management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103997094"

There is an extremely high number of accident cases that occur worldwide every minute, hour, and day. Some accidents are minor, while others are fatal, and they usually happen unexpectedly. In some cases, when an accident occurs, information is not relayed to nearby healthcare facilities in time, or there is no access to emergency services or first aid, resulting in tragic loss of life. Taking all of these issues into account, it is absolutely necessary to develop a system capable of analyzing the situation and operating in an efficient manner in order to overcome the time lag between the occurrence of an accident and the availability of medical services. This paper presents an intelligent and efficient IoT system solution that instantly alerts the family member whenever an accident occurs and sends the accident's location on a map. The vehicle's ESP32 microcontroller's integration of intelligent sensors makes this possible. These sensors turn on in the event of an accident. The GPS and GSM components are utilized for alerting, finding the accident area, and instantly texting concerned family members and close-by hospitals. The accident and location data may be accessed on a mobile device using the open source Blynk application which is primarily developed for IOT applications. © 2022 IEEE.","Accelerometer; Blynk Application; ESP32 Microcontroller; GPS; GSM; IR Sensor; MQ-3 Gas Sensor; Ultrasonic Sensor","Accidents; Emergency services; Global positioning system; Global system for mobile communications; Internet of things; mHealth; Ultrasonic applications; Accident case; Accident detections; Automated vehicles; Blynk application; ESP32 microcontroller; Gas-sensors; Healthcare facility; IR sensor; MQ-3 gas sensor; Vehicle accidents; Microcontrollers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145349303"

Recognizing human activities is particularly important in detecting abnormal activities and tracking a person's physical activity, especially in healthcare applications, among many others. In this paper, HAR analysis is conducted with three different machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision tree, and random forest methods) based on smartphone sensors. Machine learning algorithms are capable of identifying and differentiating between different human activities using mobile phone sensor data. The smartphone sensors (gyroscope and accelerometer) data are recorded at the Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation University campus, Guntur, India, with different human activities. In this research work, the data from smartphone mobile sensors were initially analysed with SVM, decision tree, and random forest algorithms. To evaluate the machine learning algorithm's accuracy, F1 score for different smartphone sensors for both individually and combined is estimated. The results indicate that the proposed machine learning methods can derive a relation between type of activity, algorithm, smartphone sensors data, and their corresponding accuracy.

These hybrid systems intelligently improve decision-making in a variety of fields, including education, business, healthcare as well as security. IoT can use machine learning to decipher hidden patterns in large amounts of data, allowing for better forecasting and recommendation engines. In healthcare, ML is utilised for disease assessment and treatment predictions, as well as target discovery and verification, pharmaceutical product development, biomarker recognition, and pathogenesis. Government expenditure on healthcare has achieved an all-time peak, despite the obvious need for improved patient-physician communication. In the areas of smartphone applications, computer appliances, online websites, cybersecurity, and other areas, such techniques have already been used. A 'health prediction system' deals with the problem of unexpected changes among hospital patient flows. Emergency occurrences such as 'ambulance arrivals during natural catastrophes' and 'motor vehicle accidents', as well as normal outpatient demand, generate demand for healthcare services in many hospitals. These healthcare related issues can be managed by using ML algorithms. In order to collect important information, this research paper has considered primary quantitative or survey method by considering 78 healthcare professionals to get proper information. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Big data; health prediction system; Healthcare services; Machine Learning (ML); survey analysis; Technology; Tumour","Accidents; Big data; Decision making; Domestic appliances; Forecasting; Hospitals; Hybrid systems; Internet of things; mHealth; Smartphones; Surveys; Artificial intelligence; Extracting information; Health prediction system; Healthcare services; Machine learning; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Prediction systems; Survey analysis; Technology; Machine learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135480894"

Academic and emotional aspects are both leading causes contributing to high-stress levels in India's undergraduate students. The existing clinical methods for stress monitoring and diagnosis lack real-time monitoring, which is vital to provide key insights and timely interventions for better stress management. Keeping this in mind, a Privacy-Preserving Automated Stress Monitoring System, 'ARU' has been designed and developed in this work. ARU includes unobtrusive multimodal data collection from multiple devices such as smartphones and low-cost wearable sensors. The data collected from these devices use multiple data modalities such as physiological, social, and behavioral signals to provide realtime diagnosis and help stressed individuals. Our work has been customized for Indian academic settings. An Android application has been built for data collection purposes and provides machine learning-driven insights on individuals' stress conditions. Well-known stress surveys such as Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Daily Stress Inventory (DSI) are used to validate the predictions on the data collected.

This technology overcomes the traditional computing methods in terms of communication delay and energy consumption, thereby providing high reliability and bandwidth for devices. In today's world, mobile edge computing is improving in various forms so as to provide better output and there is no room for simple computing architecture for MEC. So, this paper proposed a secure and energy-efficient computational offloading scheme using LSTM. The prediction of the computational tasks is done using the LSTM algorithm, the strategy for computation offloading of mobile devices is based on the prediction of tasks, and the migration of tasks for the scheme of edge cloud scheduling helps to optimize the edge computing offloading model. Experiments show that our proposed architecture, which consists of an LSTM-based offloading technique and routing (LSTMOTR) algorithm, can efficiently decrease total task delay with growing data and subtasks, reduce energy consumption, and bring much security to the devices due to the firewall nature of LSTM.  © 2022 Muhammad Arif et al.","","Computational efficiency; Computer architecture; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Long short-term memory; mHealth; Communication delays; Communication energy; Computing methods; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; High bandwidth; High reliability; Mobile Technology; Rapid growth; Traditional computing; Mobile edge computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123188403"

There is increasing evidence that demonstrates clinically relevant benefits from self-monitoring and self-management of blood pressure. Evidence suggests a reduction of systolic BP by 3.2 mm/hg through self-monitoring. The use of mHealth applications in health care monitoring and self-management can help in the timely delivery of health information. Around 33% of Indians use mHealth applications in their daily life. However, well-designed, user complied mHealth applications are essential to reach the masses and to be effective. A previously conducted study in India demonstrated that applications are not customized according to users' needs and expectations and lacked usability assessment by patients. Therefore, we aimed to develop and test a novel mHealth application on remote monitoring and self-management in hypertension. Methods: The study will be carried out in three phases. The first phase will be an in-depth interview to identify the required parameters to develop a customized mHealth android-based application to monitor hypertension. The second phase is to develop the customized application through the Agile development design using the android studio platform. In the third phase, a community-based cluster randomized trial will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention on the remote monitoring and self-management of people with hypertension. A sample of 236 people from 12 villages will be randomized and the mHealth application will be delivered to the intervention group and the standard regimen will be continued in the control group. Results: In the proposed study if the intervention is found to be helpful, then hypertension patients in the community can be encouraged to install the mHealth application. This application, if found effective can improve the health status, knowledge, and self-care approach among hypertensive patients.

However, some people require regular monitoring due to physiological needs in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Especially for the elderly and those who have been in a coma for a long time, it is critical to regularly measure and inform their loved ones' wellness at work. This research work proposed an innovative LoRa-loT-based intelligent healthcare system using Artificial intelligence. All patients' healthcare data can be transmitted to Cloud through the LoRA transceiver. Also, the bed up/down can be controlled through Online Voice Command using Artificial Intelligence. An intelligent hospital health remote control system has been proposed to monitor patients' health at a hospital and acquire a doctor's prescription. Doctors can also identify patients' illnesses using data collected remotely from them. Android-based mobile applications are utilized as an interface for web-based applications to execute effective real-time communication involving doctors and patients using LoRA-IoT. This approach uses five sensors to collect data from the hospital environment: a heart rate sensor, a body temperature sensor, a room-temperature sensor, a CO sensor, and a max30100 sensor. Incorporating specific functions in mobile intelligent hospital automation equipment enables remote monitoring at the hospital and makes life more comfortable. As a result, patients who have caused self-isolation or self-isolation can use one of the most significant variables, the mobile phone, to convey their daily health symptoms and difficulties to their doctor. As a result, it will be able to enhance patient health and live a more pleasant life.  © 2022 IEEE.","blynk application; Intelligent IoT device; max30100; pulse rate; smart hospital","Artificial intelligence; Internet of things; mHealth; Physiology; Radio transceivers; Remote control; Remote patient monitoring; Temperature sensors; Blynk application; Health data; Healthcare systems; Healthy lifestyles; Intelligent IoT device; Max30100; Monitoring and tracking; Patient health; Pulse rate; Smart hospital; Hospitals","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150229010"

The increased demand on healthcare resources in an unprecedented time makes it difficult for these patients to access traditional centralized healthcare services. The condition may become worse if they are delayed in receiving care, or there may be risks associated with visiting a facility where COVID-19 patients also receive care. A decentralized, yet personalized healthcare model is certainly needed. With the technology we currently have, different telemedicine solutions have been implemented. There are often some disadvantages to these solutions, which includes: i) applications that are too particular; ii) proprietary technologies which are not compatible; iii) the need for IT personnel trained in maintaining the system; iv) the necessity of installing additional software; v) the costs involved. There is a real need for a low-cost, easy-to-use, and compatible video conferencing architecture. In this paper, we propose such a model. A model which is economical, user-friendly, and scalable at the same time. With SDKs and APIs, web realtime communication (WebRTC) is used to provide real-time telecommunication based medical service.

Health professionals have been able to collect medical records, exchange medical data through a network of professionals and patients, provide healthcare through digital media, and track various health-related events, diseases, and disease outbreaks through a range of technologies, such as social media sites, applications, smartphones, and smart objects. This has resulted in an ample amount of knowledge related to patients that is created and needs to be handled effectively for better results. Although big data is the obvious option to handle this vast data collection, data protection and security for public health data is a prime concern. A blockchain is known as a record database located in a distributed personal computer network called nodes. In particular, it is a mutual, permanent record of peer-to-peer transactions constructed from linked blocks of transactions and stored in a digital ledger. No single person owns it, i.e., it is decentralized. The healthcare sector is one of the sectors looking to embrace the blockchain. This chapter aims to reflect the numerous facts leading to the introduction of blockchain technology in general and electronic medical record management of healthcare in particular. The chapter will study the various blockchain implementation frameworks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Digital ledger; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record (EMR); ICT; Pervasive healthcare","Digital devices; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed ledger; Electronic document exchange; Medical computing; mHealth; Peer to peer networks; Personal computers; Records management; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Wearable technology; Block-chain; Digital ledg; Electronic medical record; Healthcare record; ICT; Pervasive healthcare; Record management; Smart phones; Social media networks; Wearable devices; Blockchain","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119508248"

Methods: As part of the ZikaPLAN project, an International Committee developed an app for the description and coding of congenital anomalies that are externally visible at birth, for use in low resource settings. The “basic” version of the app was designed for a basic clinical setting and to overcome language and terminology barriers by providing diagrams and photos, sourced mainly from international Birth Defects Atlases. The “surveillance” version additionally allows recording of limited pseudonymized data relevant to diagnosis, which can be uploaded to a secure server, and downloaded by the surveillance program data center. Results: The app contains 98 (88 major and 10 minor) externally visible anomalies and 12 syndromes (including congenital Zika syndrome), with definitions and International Classification of Disease v10 -based code. It also contains newborn examination videos and links to further resources. The user taps a region of the body, then selects among a range of images to choose the congenital anomaly that best resembles what they observe, with guidance regarding similar congenital anomalies. The “basic” version of the app has been reviewed by experts and made available on the Apple and Google Play stores. Since its launch in November 2019, it has been downloaded in 39 countries. The “surveillance” version is currently being field-tested. Conclusion: The global birth defects app is a mHealth tool that can help in developing congenital anomaly surveillance in low resource settings to support prevention and care. © 2021 The Authors.

Incorporating personalized motion samples can improve the accuracy of motion detection by mobile devices or wearable devices that are tailored to the individual. Recent works have demonstrated that the use of machine learning and statistical techniques can detect human activities more accurately. In this paper, we have classified two different physical activities, viz., walking and brisk-walking using a deep neural network (DNN). The personalized data has been collected using multiple sensors of the mobile phone with the two kinds of physical activity. Using mobile phone sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, etc, data has been collected, examined, and used for training and testing the DNN model.

The digital well-being framework in Android and iOS devices present statistics on phone usage and time spent on apps. However, these tools provide the data on only an hourly basis, so we cannot utilize it in any form for long-term behavioral analysis of smartphone users. Several academic works have studied smartphone user behaviors by developing and installing custom mobile apps that record mobile app usage and built-in sensor data. The studies reveal that prolonged smartphone usage negatively impacts users' physical and mental health. However, these apps are available upon request and may sometimes crash due to operating system versions. Despite hundreds of screen time and sensor data apps on Google PlayStore, they are available separately and not as a single all-in-one app. In this work, we present a unified mobile application that collects phone usage and sensor data with minute-by-minute levels of granularity and infers human physical activity, sleep, and unlock duration.

Despite huge efforts to contain the disease spread, it is still on the rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection. In order to prevent the community spread, a nationwide lockdown was implemented, due to which many restrictions were imposed on movements of citizens within the country. Since the dental professionals were at the forefront of acquiring the infection, the majority of the dental clinics were shut for routine dental procedures. Only emergency treatment was provided to the patients. However, due to restrictions in movement, it was difficult for the patients to visit the clinics for routine check-ups. This was overcome by the advancements in technology which has a major impact on medicine. Due to increased usage of smartphones and related software applications, the clinical data exchange was facilitated between patients and clinicians which has been termed as ""teledentistry.""Teledentistry is a combination of telecommunications and dentistry, involving the exchange of clinical information and images for dental consultation and treatment planning.

According to a recent report published by the WHO, over 8 million of people attempt suicide around the year every year, which means in every 40 seconds 1 person commits suicide among them, and 60% of suicidal deaths are caused by depression. Depression is such a silent killer that a person can’t even be aware of his depressive status. Also, some additional factors like our mental and societal barriers sojourn us from going to a psychologist’s chamber for a consultancy. Moreover, the depressive symbols are not always very explicit.

There are already some efforts where health practitioners interact with patients in rural areas through mobile applications that provide audio and visual communication. It could be useful to augment this interaction with some measure of tactile communication between the doctor and patient. One application of such tactile interaction is perceiving tissue stiffness increase due to ailments such as liver cirrhosis that is prevalent in rural India. The goal of this paper is to perform a preliminary computer simulation study to ascertain whether a pair of simple planar two-link manipulators forming a teleoperated master-slave system over mobile phone networks (these are ubiquitous even in rural India) are capable of 'qualitatively' discerning liver stiffness change due to cirrhosis. It is shown that the error in stiffness estimation is reasonably small compared to the increase in liver stiffness due to cirrhosis and is acceptable to obtain a 'qualitative' sense of increase in liver stiffness due to disease.  © 2020 IEEE.","","Agricultural robots; Manipulators; mHealth; Robotics; Stiffness; Visual communication; Communication delays; Master-slave systems; Mobile applications; Mobile phone networks; Simulation studies; Tactile communications; Tactile interaction; Two-link manipulator; Rural areas","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095599325"

Owing to overcrowded hospitals and inadequate medical infrastructure, traditional ways of examining and monitoring patients are ineffective. For the treatment of Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs) like COVID-19, monitoring a patient's SpO2 level along with the pulse rate is vital. This paper focuses on using IoT devices for documenting essential patient characteristics and performing data analytics on them for future predictions. Pulse oximeter sensor is used to obtain the patient's SpO2 level and pulse rate measurements. This sensor output is processed by Wi-Fi SoC NodeMCU. By unique identification of each patient, this data is displayed via a Mobile application to healthcare workers nearby. By analysing a patient's symptoms, a doctor can remotely regulate the supply of oxygen to the patient with the same mobile application. Machine learning algorithm is trained to analyse and predict a patient's future health conditions. With the adoption of such systems, the existing medical structure could improve vastly in its efficiency and capabilities during a healthcare crisis such as COVID-19.  © 2021 IEEE.","Active patient monitoring; Internet of Things; Pulse oximetry; Real time data analysis; Real time remote monitoring","Data Analytics; Developing countries; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; mHealth; Mobile computing; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Patient monitoring; Pulmonary diseases; Active patient monitoring; Distribution systems; Mobile applications; Oxygen distribution; Pulse oximetry; Pulse rate; Pulse-oximetry; Real time data analysis; Real-time health monitoring; Real-time remote monitoring; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130595360"

Thus, many scholars have conducted research to develop new tools and applications. Processing information, usually in the form of binary code, is the main task in DTs, which is happening through many devices, including computers, smartphones, robots, and applications. Surprisingly, the role of DTs has been highlighted in people's life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several different challenges to implement and intervene in DTs during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, the present study extended a new fuzzy approach under Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS) approach using Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method to evaluate and rank the critical challenges of DTs intervention to control the COVID-19 outbreak. In this regard, a comprehensive survey using literature and in-depth interviews have been carried out to identify the challenges under the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework. Moreover, the SWARA procedure is applied to analyze and assess the challenges to DTs intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the WASPAS approach is utilized to rank the DTs under hesitant fuzzy sets. Further, to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the developed framework, an illustrative case study has been analyzed. The results of this study found that Health Information Systems (HIS) was ranked as the first factor among other factors followed by a lack of digital knowledge, digital stratification, economic interventions, lack of reliable data, and cost inefficiency In conclusion, to confirm the steadiness and strength of the proposed framework, the obtained outputs are compared with other methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 pandemic; Digital technologies; Fuzzy decision making; Healthcare systems; Hesitant fuzzy sets; MCDM; SWARA; WASPAS","mHealth; Cost inefficiencies; Critical challenges; Digital stratification; Digital technologies; Health information systems; Health interventions; In-depth interviews; Tools and applications; Fuzzy sets","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089337030"

In this context, many research works have unveiled incredible results using various smartphone sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, digital compass, microphone, GPS and camera. The waveform of sensor motion is quite different in several smartphone placements even for the identical activity. This makesit challenging to apprehend varied completely different activities with high precision. Due to the difference in behavioral habits, gender and age, the movement patterns of various individuals vary greatly, which boosts the problem of dividing boundaries of various activities. In HAMR, the main computational tasks are quantitative analysis of human motion and its automatic classification. These cause the inception of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to automatically recognize various human activity signals collected using smartphone sensors.

Additionally, we sought to estimate relationships between participant knowledge on hypertension and sociodemographic variables. Background: The World Health Organization advocates for the use of mobile technology to improve public health outcomes. Introduction: The incidence of hypertension is on the rise in India, and effective and sustainable interventions are needed. Methods: A quantitative single arm pre-test post-test interventional and correlational design was used to test the hypertension mHealth application among participants in a limited resource setting. A paired t-test was performed to compare pre- and post-test results after participant use of the mHealth application. A regression model was used to estimate relationships between participant hypertension health literacy and sociodemographic variables. Results: A statistically significant improvement in test scores among participants after use of the mHealth app was found. Sociodemographic characteristics such as living in an urban environment, married, increased number of people living in household and alcohol use were determined to have a statistically significant effect on improvement of test score. Discussion: Results indicated the application was effective among participants with varied literacy and health literacy levels. These findings contribute to the potential widespread scalability of the app among populations with varied demographics. Conclusion: This application provides an effective and valuable culturally tailored educational resource for nurses and other health providers to use to improve hypertension health literacy among vulnerable populations in India. Implications for Nursing Practice and Health Policy: This study contributes to nursing and health policy by answering a call from the World Health Organization to implement and research mHealth interventions to improve health outcomes, particularly in a low and middle income country where preventive health access is limited. © 2020 International Council of Nurses","health literacy; hypertension; India; mHealth; mobile health","Health Literacy; Humans; Hypertension; India; Telemedicine; health literacy; human; hypertension; India; telemedicine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089103247"

One of them is the e-health system, which can provide people with high-quality and convenient health care. Meanwhile, it is a key issue and challenge to protect the privacy and security of the user's personal health record. Some cryptographic methods have been proposed such as encrypt user's data before sharing it. However, it is complicated to share the data with multiple parties (doctors, health departments, etc.), due to the fact that data should be encrypted under each recipient's keys. Although several (t,n) threshold secret sharing schemes can share the data only need one encryption operation, there is a limitation that the decryption private key has to be reconstructed by one party. To offset this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose an efficient identity-based distributed decryption scheme for personal health record sharing system. It is convenient to share their data with multiple parties and does not require to reconstruct the decryption private key. We prove that our scheme is secure under chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA). Moreover, we implement our scheme by using the Java pairing-based cryptography (JPBC) library on a laptop and an Android phone. The experimental results show that our system is practical and effective in the electronic personal health record system.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Distributed decryption; e-health system; identity-based encryption; privacy; security","Internet of things; mHealth; Public key cryptography; Chosen ciphertext attack; Cryptographic methods; Encryption operations; Internet of thing (IOT); Pairing-based cryptography; Personal health record; Privacy and security; Threshold secret sharing; Electronic document exchange","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090432038"

HAR models based on smartphone’s accelerometer data could provide a convenient and ubiquitous solution to this problem. However, such models are mostly concerned with identifying basic activities such as ‘stand’/‘walk’ and thus the high-level context such as ‘walk in a queue’ for which a set of specific activities is performed remain unnoticed. Consequently, in this paper, we design a HAR framework that can identify a group of activities (rather than a single basic activity) being performed in a time window, thus, enables us to extract more meaningful information about the subject’s overall context. An algorithm is designed to formulate HAR as a multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning problem. The procedure of generating feature bags of consecutive activity traces having multiple labels is formulated. In this work, the temporal relationship among activities is exploited to obtain a more comprehensive HAR model. Interestingly, the framework is found to completely/partially identify activity sequences that may not even be present in the training dataset. The framework is implemented and found to be working adequately when tested with real dataset collected from 8 users for 12 different activity combinations. MIML-kNN is found to provide maximum average precision (around 90%) even for an unseen test data-set. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Accelerometer; Activity recognition; Composite activity; Multi-instance and multi-label learning; Semi supervised learning","Medical applications; mHealth; Pattern recognition; Accelerometer data; Activity sequence; Human activity recognition; Learning problem; Multiple instances; Specific activity; Temporal relationships; Training dataset; Statistical tests","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096772589"

However, it is more important to recognize the activity sequences in terms of transitions. In this work, we have designed a detailed activity transition recognition framework that can identify a set of activity transitions and their sequence for a time window. This enables us to extract more meaningful insight about the subject’s physical and behavioral context. However, precise labeling of training data for detailed activity transitions at every time instance is required for this purpose. But, due to non uniformity of individual gait, the labeling tends to be error prone. Accordingly, our contribution in this work is to formulate the activity transition detection problem as a multiple instance learning problem to deal with imprecise labeling of data. The proposed human activity transition recognition framework forms an ensemble model based on different MIML-kNN distance metrics. The ensemble model helps to find both the activity sequence as well as multiple activity transition. The framework is implemented for a real dataset collected from 8 users. It is found to be working adequately (average precision 0.94). © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Activity sequence; Activity transition; Detailed activity; MIML; Smartphone","Accelerometers; Medical applications; Patient monitoring; Patient rehabilitation; Smartphones; Activity sequence; Distance metrics; Ensemble modeling; Human activities; Human Activity Monitoring; Multiple instance learning; Non-uniformities; Transition detection; mHealth","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096014245"

SkinAid classifies and provides information on several skin lesions. In this regard, the highly unbalanced and limited data leads the existing Deep Learning models to overfit or poorly generalize, resulting in re-duced performance. We explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment and enhance the dataset.

Due to the full acceptance of the above control practices, frequent hospital contact visits are being discouraged. However, there are people whose physiological vital needs still require routine monitoring for improved healthy living. Interestingly, with the recent technological advancements in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart home automation, and healthcare systems, contact-based hospital visits are now regarded as nonobligatory. To this end, a remote smart home healthcare support system (ShHeS) is proposed for monitoring patients’ health status and receiving doctors’ prescriptions while staying at home. Besides this, doctors can also carry out the diagnosis of ailments using the data collected remotely from the patient. An Android based mobile application that interfaces with a web-based application is implemented for efficient patients-doctors dual real-time communication. Sensors are incorporated in the system for automatic capturing of physiological health parameters of patients. Also, a hyperspace analogue to context (HAC) was incorporated into the current monitoring framework for service discovery and context change in the home environment towards accurate readings of the physiological parameters and improved system performance. With the proposed system, patients can be remotely monitored from their homes, and can also live a more comfortable life through the use of some features of smart home automation devices on their phones. Therefore, one main significant contribution of this study is that patients in self-isolation or self-quarantine can use the new platform to send daily health symptoms and challenges to doctors via their mobile phones. Thus, improved healthy living and a comfortable lifestyle can still be achieved even during such a problematic period of the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic that has already recorded 20,026,186 million cases so far with 734,020 thousand deaths globally. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2021.","Contact-based hospital; Internet of Things (IoT) technology; Smart home automation, and healthcare systems","Coronavirus; Diagnosis; Hospitals; Internet of things; mHealth; Physiological models; Physiology; Contact-based hospital; Coronaviruses; Healthcare support; Home automation systems; Home healthcare systems; Internet of things technologies; Routine monitoring; Smart home automation, and healthcare system; Smart homes; Standard practices; Automation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117785111"

This project presents an effective system for the estimation of a pulse rate from facial videos. A dataset of 160 videos with pulse rate has been introduced. The dataset is obtained from 20 subjects performing 4 activities in 2 lighting conditions. Each activity is captured by a smartphone camera placed on a tripod. This dataset with facial videos and pulse rate is trained on different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to predict the pulse rate. Their performances were compared to obtain better results. Another method called Eulerian video magnification (EVM) was also implemented with the same dataset and the results were compared with the CNN results for better accuracy.

The rapid growth of wireless communication has gained momentum for the development of value-added services such as voice, data, and video ubiquitously. Continuous development has emerged in various application domains such as healthcare, surveillance, and automation that integrate the sources of multimedia to support real-time analysis. In mHealth, it has a dedicated multimedia information system (MIS) to support diagnosis, treatment, medicare, and report preparation. It may enable the user to collect the diagnostic information over smart devices. On the other hand, it may eliminate the geographical restriction between users and medical experts to manage medical emergencies. It uses a packet-switched network to cooperate with the wireless infrastructure to provide a standard interface that serves as a data transmission network. However, the communication interface such as real-time transport protocol is still challenging to authenticate the network services, key exchanges, and session blockage in the multimedia systems. Thus, this paper proposes a technique of session scheme interrogation (SSI) and robust lightweight privacy-preserving (RLPP) to resolve the major issues of LTE-A networks. In this paper, the session adaptive strategy is mathematically driven to adopt the session probing in multimedia clients that detects the session blocks proficiently to mitigate the session overheads. Besides, a real-time system has been designed and developed for the analysis of quality metrics such as call success rate, call setup time, end-to-end session delay, RTP utilization, bandwidth consumption, and flooding attack detection rate. The examination results prove that the proposed RLPP and SSI achieve better efficiencies than other existing schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bandwidth Consumption; Lightweight; Multimedia Information System; Privacy-Preserving; Session Delay; Session Initiation Protocol; Transmission Network","Diagnosis; Fog computing; Health care; Health insurance; Interactive computer systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Packet switching; Privacy by design; Quality control; Real time systems; Voice/data communication systems; Bandwidth consumption; Communication interface; Continuous development; MultiMedia Information Systems; Real time transport protocols; Session initiation protocol; Wireless communications; Wireless infrastructures; Internet protocols","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100121440"

We share our early experience of developing and deploying the InStrat COVID-19 health worker training application (App) in Ogun State, Western Nigeria where the country's first COVID-19 case was reported. This App was designed to directly provide frontline health workers with accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19; enable them to quickly identify, screen and manage COVID-19 suspects; provide guidance on specimen collection techniques and safety measures to observe within wards and quarantine centers dealing with COVID-19. The App was deployed in 271 primary health care facilities in Ogun state and a total of 311 health workers were trained to use it. Of the 123 health workers who completed knowledge pre- and post-tests, their average test score improved from 47.5 (±9.4) to 73.1(±10.0) %, P < 0.0001 after using the tutorial. Rapid adoption and uptake were driven largely by public-private sector involvement as well as certification of health workers with reported satisfaction levels of over 95% among those who completed pre- and post-test surveys. Challenges encountered included a lack of universal availability of android phones for frontline health workers, lack of internet access in remote areas and a need to incentivize the workers. The timely deployment of this App targeting primary health care workers, mostly in hard-to-reach areas, obviated the need for conventional didactic training with potential of savings in training costs and time and could be applied to similar contexts.

Lack of auditory stimulation restricts the ability of children to communicate using spoken language. Consequently, this hinders educational, social and career choices for children as they grow up. The standard of care for children with hearing impairment involves providing appropriate amplification devices (external/implanted) followed by speech and language therapy. The process of therapy is time and labor-intensive for all stakeholders. Regular compliance to therapy requires considerable time commitment by the parent/caretaker, which further implies a cost burden pertaining to therapy sessions and/or loss of wages. These challenges are compounded by the dearth, and a skewed distribution of qualified speech therapists in resource-constrained settings. An affordable intervention was proposed in our earlier work, wherein a smartphone application could facilitate home-based therapy for children with hearing impairment. Further discussions with stakeholders led to identification of other drawbacks in the current system of rehabilitation including lack of means to monitor and track the child's progress during home-therapy. In this work, we propose the use of response channels to serve as quantitative metrics in analyzing and quantifying a child's progress during the process of therapy.

At present, the medical field is progressing well and facilitating the people to consult doctor even online which we normally term as telemedicine. Such a system should be automated to make it even more effective. Healthcare automation ensures physical and moral support to the patient and reduces the need of a caretaker near the patient. In order to make automation possible in health care, Internet of Things (IoT) contributes a lot. The proposed work is based on Internet of Things being connected to electronic devices via a public or private cloud to catch or screen information and empowers them to naturally trigger certain occasions or events. It also includes various monitoring system in healthcare such as heart beat rate monitor, pill bottle and drips bottle remainder, electronic paralysis patient caretaker. These monitoring systems are used to monitor patient health remotely using sensors and mobile communication devices. The heart beat sensor is used which monitors the heart rate of a person and transmits the heart rate readings over Internet and during abnormality, an alert message will be sent to the doctor's mobile. As it very evident that the paralyzed people will not be able to communicate properly to explain what they need, the proposed system helps the disabled person to show hand gestures which in turn will display the need of the patient on an LCD screen. It is very common that due to human nature, quite good number of people skips their medication.

Most of the people in the Indian nation are ordinary people. Many tests for Covid19 are expensive and beyond the reach of the average person. With the advent of the novel Corona Virus, every country now places great importance on health care. So this year, the best solution for such infectious diseases is the IoT-cloud based health monitoring system. The Internet is a newcomer to the field of research, especially in the field of healthcare. With the proliferation of usable sensors and therefore smartphones, this remote health care monitoring has developed at such a pace. IoT health monitoring helps to prevent the spread of the disease and to make an accurate diagnosis of the patient's health condition even if the doctor is far away. In this paper, the portable physiological checking framework will be displayed, which will be able to constantly check the patient's heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen level and blood pressure, as the main symptoms of coronavirus are high fever, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.

Here, we propose an ensemble of three classification models, namely CNN-Net, Encoded-Net, and CNN-LSTM, which is named as EnsemConvNet. Each of these classification models is built upon simple 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) but differs in terms of the number of dense layers, kernel size used along with other key differences in the architecture. Each model accepts the time series data as a 2D matrix by taking a window of data at a time in order to infer information, which ultimately predicts the type of human activity. Classification outcome of the EnsemConvNet model is decided using various classifier combination methods that include majority voting, sum rule, product rule, and a score fusion approach called adaptive weighted approach. Three benchmark datasets, namely WISDM activity prediction, UniMiB SHAR, MobiAct, are used for evaluating our proposed model. We have compared our EnsemConvNet model with some existing deep learning models such as Multi Headed CNN, hybrid of CNN, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models.

A MOF based flexible sensor is reported for the first time for breath sensing applications. The properties of a highly porous HKUST-1 MOF and a conducting MoS2 material have been combined to fabricate an electronic sensor on a flexible paper support for studying sleep apnea problems. Extensive breath sensing experiments have been performed and interestingly the fabricated sensor is efficient in detecting various kinds of breaths such as deep, fast, slow and hydrated breath. The MOF breath sensor shows a fast response time of just ∼0.38 s and excellent stability with no decline in its performance even after a month. A plausible mechanism has been proposed and a smartphone based prototype has been prepared to demonstrate the real time applications of the hybrid device.

Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; deep learning; elderly people; fall detection; parameter tuning; Smart homecare; smartphone","Automation; Cameras; Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Hospitals; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; mHealth; Smartphones; Deep learning; Detection models; Elderly falls; Elderly people; Fall detection; Homecare; Parameters tuning; Smart homecare; Smart homes; Smart phones; Fall detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117584989"

The aim of the proposed framework is to assess the human respiratory system by identifying degree-of-breathings, such as breathlessness, normal breathing, and long and labored breathing. For this, it is needed to measure cardiac-induced chest-wall vibrations, reflected in the SCG signal. Orthogonal subspace projection is employed to extract the SCG cycles with the help of a concurrent ECG signal. Subsequently, fifteen statistically significant morphological-features are extracted from each of the SCG cycles. These features can efficiently characterize physiological changes due to varying respiratory-rates. Stacked autoencoder (SAE) based architecture is employed for the identification of different respiratory-effort levels. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other standard classifiers for 1147 analyzed SCG-beats. The proposed method gives an overall average accuracy of 91.45% in recognizing three different breathing states. The quantitative analysis of the performance results clearly shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It may be employed in various healthcare applications, such as pre-screening medical sensors and IoT based remote health-monitoring systems. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","ECG; heart cycle; neural networks; respiratory efforts; Seismocardiogram; stacked autoencoder","Diagnosis; Respiratory system; Health care application; Human respiratory system; Measuring method; Morphological features; Orthogonal subspace projection; Remote health monitoring; Respiratory efforts; Vibrational signals; mHealth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099194641"

The most significant issue in such applications is energy efficiency which leads to enhanced network life time that ensures uninterrupted seamless services. From source to sink data transmission may occur considering three different scenarios: source to sink single hop direct data transmission irrespective of in-between node distance, source to sink multi hop data transmission in which transmission range of source node is fixed at a threshold to find next forwarder node and transmission range of source node is incremented by affixed value until data gets transmitted to sink. In this work WBAN having different network configurations based on fixed or random positions of nodes have been simulated. Different scenarios with fixed and varying number of nodes are framed and simulated using MATLAB 2020a for performance evaluation of proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption, network lifetime, path loss etc. due to data transmission from source to sink. Experimental results show that incremental approach is better than direct one in terms of energy consumption, path loss and network lifetime.

The number of cases has been increasing since the beginning of 2020. People are scared and trying to save themselves. Although many vaccines are designed to prevent disease, many governments across different countries have not been able to control the virus. Coronavirus has changed the way people live. It has a profound impact on parts of North America, South Asia and African countries. Even European countries have begun to adapt to the 'new standard'. However, due to mismanagement and lack of essential facilities, the health care system in South Asian and African countries has collapsed. In India, there is scarcity of hospital equipment's such as Ventilators, beds, Oxygen bottles. According to WHO, India has only 5 hospital beds per 1000 persons and is ranked at 155th position among 167 countries. Although, the government has been trying their best to add hospitals beds and equipment's but they are not adequate enough to balance the rising cases of Coronavirus. Even after setting up only 3000 hospitals for the purpose of containing coronavirus and reducing its spread, many people in India died as a result of mistreatment by city officials and improper implementation of the rescue program. Apart from Coronavirus, there are many other diseases out there which are harmful and contagious, but such disease can be cured at home itself just by having a remote treatment from doctor. The patients do not need to visit a hospital, thus saving the beds and equipment's for the others who are in more need of it. To implement this idea, technology can be a blessing. In everyday life, people order food and cab within minutes and watch live stock market points and sports results on their mobile phones from time to time; where many businesses are successful only because they are able to meet the needs with greater management our technology can be used to provide people around the world with a simple Virtual Hospital web system that simplifies the Hospital Health Care process to help patients, doctors, labs, and chemists. This will not only help the people but also the hospital staff by reducing their paperwork and administrative responsibilities. Patients can easily book their appointments and can arrange an online examination with a doctor. The web application can be easily accessed from mobile phones, laptops and desktops and can be useful to people in such difficult times. In addition, the application can be partnered with authorized pharmacies to provide quality medicines at the discounted price. The aim is to help the elderly and the disabled and people who have simple flu or other disease to gain treatment from doctors at low Door-step rates.

With widespread and ever-growing cell phone penetration and rapid developments in mobile technology, the prominence of mobile health (m-health) tools has increased as a valuable strategy for secondary prevention and management of chronic disease conditions. Due to an increasing aging population in India, along with a substantial rise in chronic disease and multimorbidity, the topic of healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) has become more relevant than ever. Many trials have been performed globally to evaluate the effect of mhealth tools on the quality of life of a wide range of population. However, there is dearth of scientific data on the impact of these tools on the HRQOL of chronic disease patients from emerging economies like India. Objective. To evaluate the effect of an indigenous bilingual m-health education program on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients. Methodology. This was an open label, randomized, experimental clinical study conducted in medically managed stable CAD patients in a reputed hospital in North India. For this study a m-health based educational program comprising of a mobile application and SMS program was developed. Expert evaluation of the mobile application was conducted using Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) followed by a pilot user satisfaction survey done with 35 CAD patients. Thereafter a randomized clinical study using this m-health program was conducted in 312 CAD patients. HRQOL was the primary endpoint assessed using validated RAND-36 self-reported questionnaire. The statistical analysis was carried out using R Statistical Software, version 3.6.1. Happy heart program was administered to experimental group patients along with usual medical care for a period of 6 months. ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis tests were performed to determine the impact of the intervention on the comparative HRQOL scores of experimental versus non-experimental groups at baseline, at 6 months and at 9 months. Results. The study intervention namely ""Happy Heart Program"" comprising of an AndroidTM based bilingual mobile phone application along with a short message service (SMS) program was developed to deliver educational/informative/reminder content to patients in the experimental group. The mean MARS rating for the mobile application was 3.60 ± 0.86 and average user satisfaction score was 4.09 ± 0.75. The randomized controlled trial (n = 312) was conducted for 6 months with a 9-month final follow up and data collection time point. Statistical analysis done using ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis tests showed significant improvement in the experimental group for most of the HRQOL domain scores from baseline to 6 months and overall study duration from baseline to 9 months' time point (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Present m-health study showed positive impact and effectiveness of this indigenous m-Health based education program on the HRQOL of patients who received the intervention. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Coronary artery disease; Health-related quality of life; Hrqol; M-health; Rand-36","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109466757"

Wayfinding in healthcare facilities is even more challenging because of additional mental stress. This work proposes a novel framework to address information needs for wayfinding and physical accessibility. This work is based on an immersion in the proposed healthcare facility keeping PVDs as the prime focus. The studied healthcare journey consists of three major tasks for visitors, i.e. registration, consultation, and follow-up (RCF). Access to information when required in time and space is a critical need for these tasks. We propose a generic framework to create and update the required information and can be easily adapted to other public facilities. It provides an easy annotation interface to create a navigation map. Information requirement was derived through a comprehensive survey of existing standards and a set of interviews with stakeholders. We developed an 'IncluNav' application to provide turn by turn navigation instruction by integrating bluetooth beacons and smartphone's inertial sensor data. The application provides both visual and audio instructions based on visitors' choice and location. Limited testing has shown the effectiveness of annotation tool in the creation, update, and release of accessible digital maps. Our limited field testing shows that the 'IncluNav' application is capable of providing critical information including wayfinding directions to a diverse set of visitors resulting in an improved journey experience.  © 2021 IEEE.","Accessibility; Digital Mapping; Indoor Navigation; Information Accessibility; Person with Visually Disabilities(PVDs); Wayfinding","Ubiquitous computing; Address informations; Annotation tool; Generic frameworks; Healthcare facility; Inertial sensor; Information requirement; Public facilities; Visual disability; mHealth","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107580034"

This paper proposes a real-time remote patient monitoring system based on the Internet of Things that can monitor the basic vital signs of the patient, such as body temperature, heartbeat rate, and blood pressure. The core of the system is a wearable device consisting of a microcontroller, a Wi-Fi module, and sensors. Sensors are used to capture patient's vital signs, and the data captured by the sensors is transmitted to the cloud database via a Wi-Fi module. The doctor can real-time monitor the patient via an Android-based smartphone application or retrieve previously recorded data via a website. Moreover, the system will send a notification to the doctor application if any of the vital signs exceed the predefined threshold value.

For instance, IoT applications, such as smart health-care and smart homes, provide automated services to the users with less or no user intervention. As these application use user-sensitive data, ensuring their security and privacy should be paramount, especially during the key management process. However, traditional approaches for key management will not suit well in IoT environment because of the inherent resource constraint property of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed key management scheme for IoT ecosystem. The proposed scheme efficiently provides security to IoT devices by delegating most of the resource consuming cryptographic processing to a local entity. This entity coordinates with other peer entities to provide a distributed key as well as an authentication mechanism to network devices. In particular, the proposed scheme exploits the advantages of mobile agents by deploying them in different subnetworks as and when required: (1) to process the cryptography work for the IoT devices, and (2) to act as an local authenticated entity to perform fast authentication process. To verify the effectiveness and correctness of our proposed scheme, we have simulated it in a large IoT scenario and evaluated against relevant metrics that includes user mobility, certification generation time, and communication overhead. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Internet of Things; Mobile agents; Resource exhaustion; Security; Wireless networks","Authentication; Automation; Cryptography; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Home health care; Intelligent buildings; mHealth; Mobile agents; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Wireless networks; Authentication mechanisms; Communication overheads; Distributed key management; Internet of Things (IOT); Resource exhaustion; Security; Technological improvements; Traditional approaches; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067809222"

COVID-19 is different only in that everyone is encountering it for the first time during this pandemic. The world has gone from complete ignorance to a blitz of details in a matter of months. The foremost challenge that the scientific community faces is to understand the growth and transmission capability of the virus. As the world grapples with the global pandemic, people are spending more time than ever before living and working in the digital milieu, and the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is propelled to an unprecedented level especially as AI has already proven to play an important role in counteracting COVID-19. AI and Data Science are rapidly becoming important tools in clinical research, precision medicine, biomedical discovery and medical diagnostics. Machine learning (ML) and their subsets, such as deep learning, are also referred to as cognitive computing due to their foundational basis and relationship to cognition. To date, AI based techniques are helping epidemiologists in projecting the spread of virus, contact tracing, early detection, monitoring, social distancing, compiling data and training of healthcare workers. Beside AI, the use of telemedicine, mobile health or mHealth and the Internet of Things (IOT) is also emerging. These techniques have proven to be powerful tools in fighting against the pandemic because they provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control.

POM was implemented as an addition to routine antenatal care by accredited social health activists (ASHAs) and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) during the community level intervention for pre-eclampsia (CLIP) Trial in Karnataka state, India (NCT01911494). The objective of this study was to evaluate the experiences of CHWs of using POM in rural India and their perceptions of acceptability and feasibility of this mHealth intervention. Methods: A posttrial mixed-methods evaluation was designed to measure CHW knowledge and self-efficacy regarding the care of women with pre-eclampsia and perceptions of CHWs on the ease of use and usefulness of POM. A structured survey with open-ended questions was conducted between October and November 2017. The median values on a 5-point Likert scale for knowledge and self-efficacy questions were compared between trial arms by Mann–Whitney U test (p < 0.05 significant). Qualitative analysis was undertaken on NVivo 12 (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). Results: A total of 48 ASHAs and ANMs were interviewed, including 24 who used POM (intervention arm) and 24 who did not (control arm). Self-reported knowledge and self-efficacy for the care of women with pre-eclampsia did not differ between groups. The qualitative analysis highlighted that health workers who used POM reported improved interactions with women and families in their communities. POM strengthened the role of ASHA as a CHW beyond a “link-worker” accompanying women to health services. With training, the mHealth application was easy to use even for CHWs who did not have much experience with smartphones. Conclusions: Community health workers found the POM app easy to use, useful, and well-received by women and their families. POM did not improve care through increased knowledge but built capacity by increasing the recognition of the ASHA and ANM as critical members of the continuum of antenatal healthcare within their communities. These findings support the important role that mHealth technologies can play in strengthening health systems to reach rural, remote, and marginalized populations to reduce disparities in health.

Applying IoT in healthcare 4.0, massive amount of patients’ data is generated by the sensors and this data is accessible to the doctors at any time and at any place for analysis and for appropriate line of treatment. The sensors in the healthcare domain of IoT need to be wearable and wireless to monitor the patients on large scale. In addition, the analysis of data and decision of treatment should be done and communicated in as little amount of time as possible. Thus, the aggregation, storage, analysis, and maintenance of data should be such that the data is continuously available, portable, consistent, accurate, scalable, secure, and quickly transferable. These challenges constraint the energy, memory, communication, and processing capacity of the end devices (sensors) used. Hence, instead of relying entirely on remote data centers using Cloud computing, the gap is bridged by means of fog computing (near the healthcare premises). The factors affecting the architecture of fog computing in healthcare domain are location of patient, latency requirements, geographic distribution, heterogeneous data, scalability, real-time vs batch processing, mobility of end devices, etc. On the other side, use of fog computing in the healthcare has substantial challenges for researchers and organizations including application-oriented architecture prototype, modeling and deployment, infrastructure and network management, resource management, mobility of patients and hence data mobility, security and privacy of patients’ data, scalability, easy incorporation of various healthcare professionals’ proficiency with intelligent devices and sensors, and minimum latency time in case of life threatening situations. This chapter discusses background and research challenges of fog computing in Healthcare 4.0 with an aim to guide the researchers and stakeholders for the overall improvement in the functioning of the healthcare domain. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Cyber physical systems (CPS); Fog computing; Fog node; Healthcare; Healthcare 4.0; Internet of Things; Medical databases; Wearable sensors","Batch data processing; Computer architecture; Cyber Physical System; Cybersecurity; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Fog; Information management; Internet of things; mHealth; Network architecture; Patient treatment; Scalability; Wearable sensors; Cloud-computing; Cybe physical system; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Fog node; Healthcare 4.0; Healthcare domains; Medical database; Patient data; Research challenges; Fog computing","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090254823"

Both sensors are based on conductive poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) polymer. The highly sensitive strain sensor consists of a microfluidic channel filled with PEDOT:PSS in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The strain sensor shows 3 order (1250) increase in the resistance for 10% strain and considerably high gauge factor (GF) of 12 500. The sensor was tested for 30% strain, which is more than typical stretching of human skin or body parts such as chest expansion during respiration. The strain sensor was also tested for different bending and the electrical resolution was 150% per degree of free bending and 12k% per percentage of stretching. The resistive temperature sensor, fabricated on a Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) substrate, showed a 60% decrease in resistance when the temperature changed from 25 °C to 85 °C and a sensitivity of 1% per °C. As a proof of concept, the sensors and NFC tag were integrated on wound dressing to obtain wearable systems with smart bandage form factor. The sensors can be operated and read from distance of 25 mm with a user-friendly smartphone application developed for powering the system as well as real-Time acquisition of sensors data. Finally, we demonstrate the potential use of smart bandage in healthcare applications such as assessment of wound status or respiratory diseases, such as asthma and COVID-19, where monitoring via wearable strain (e.g., respiratory volume) and temperature sensors is critical. © 2014 IEEE.","Batteryless system; flexible electronics; near-field communication (NFC) tag; smart bandage; strain sensor; temperature sensor","Chlorine compounds; Conducting polymers; Electric batteries; mHealth; Near field communication; Polydimethylsiloxane; Polyvinyl chlorides; Silicones; Temperature sensors; Health care application; Poly-3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene; Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates; Polystyrene sulfonate; Polyvinyl chloride (PVC); Real time acquisition; Smart-phone applications; Strain and temperature sensors; Wearable sensors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099088164"

Identification of daily objects becomes a hectic task. Traditional methods such as a walking stick and a guide dog have been helpful to the visually impaired for basic navigation. Such, methods have a lot of limitations and often fail under varied situations. Technologies such as Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Image Processing (IP) Internet of Things (IoT), etc. have made a major contribution to overcoming the limitations. IoT brings a lot of technical and automated solutions to assist the visually impaired people. Data science and analytics are a major part of the process. Data accumulated via various sensors can be processed and used to identify obstacles and enhance basic navigation using haptic and voice feedback. Raw data goes through a series of analysis and refinement. This is then processed into a form which is understandable to the system and can be directly interpreted to perform various components of an application. These applications involve education, navigation, entertainment, security, consumer, etc. These applications are across various verticals of technologies differing in terms of hardware, software, and protocols. Various economically feasible and accurate solutions are now available. While, optimization remains an issue. These devices have generally been very helpful to ease the lives of visually impaired people.

The IoT foresees the interconnection of few trillions of intelligent objects around us, uniquely and addressable every day, these objects have the ability to accumulate process and communicate data about themselves and their surrounding environment. The best examples of IoT systems are health care, building smart city with advance construction management system, public and defense surveillance and data acquisition. Recent advancement in the technology has developed smart and intelligent sensor nodes and RFIDs lead to a large number of wireless networks with smart and intelligent devices (object, or things) connected to the Internet continuously transmit the data. So to provide security and privacy to this data in IoT is a very challenging task, which is to be concerned at highest priority for several current and future applications of IoT. Devices such as smart phone, WSNs and RFIDs etc., are the major components of IoT network which are basically resource constrained devices. Design and development of security and privacy management schemes for these devices is guided by factors like good performance, low power consumption, robustness to attacks, tampering of the data and end to end security. Security schemes in IoT provide unauthorized access to information or other objects by protecting against alterations or destruction. Privacy schemes maintain the right to control about the collected information for its usage and purpose. In this paper, we have surveyed major challenges such as Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Availability for IoT in a brief manner. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Internet of things; Privacy; Security","Data acquisition; Information management; mHealth; Network security; Privacy by design; Project management; Sensor nodes; Smartphones; Surveys; Construction management system; Design and Development; Intelligent sensors; Internet of thing (IOT); Low-power consumption; Resourceconstrained devices; Security and privacy; Surrounding environment; Internet of things","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088843121"

Methods: Eight scientific databases were searched. Two independent reviewers screened the literature in title and abstract stages, followed by full-text appraisal, data extraction, and synthesis of eligible studies. Studies were extracted to capture details of the mhealth tools used, the service issues addressed, the study design, and the outcomes evaluated. We then mapped the included studies using the 20 sub-strategies of the WHO Framework on Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS); as well as with the RE-AIM (Reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework, to understand how studies implemented and evaluated interventions. Results: We identified 39 studies, predominantly from Australia (n = 16), China (n = 7), Malaysia (n = 4) and New Zealand (n = 4), and little from low income countries. The mHealth modalities included text messaging, voice and video communication, mobile applications and devices (point-of-care, GPS, and Bluetooth). Health issues addressed included: medication adherence, smoking cessation, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, asthma, diabetes, and lifestyle activities respectively. Almost all were community-based and focused on service issues; only half were disease-specific. mHealth facilitated integrated IPCHS by: enabling citizens and communities to bypass gatekeepers and directly access services; increasing affordability and accessibility of services; strengthening governance over the access, use, safety and quality of clinical care; enabling scheduling and navigation of services; transitioning patients and caregivers between care sectors; and enabling the evaluation of safety and quality outcomes for systemic improvement. Evaluations of mHealth interventions did not always report the underlying theories. They predominantly reported cognitive/behavioural changes rather than patient outcomes. The utility of mHealth to support and improve IPCHS was evident. However, IPCHS strategy 2 (participatory governance and accountability) was addressed least frequently. Implementation was evaluated in regard to reach (n = 30), effectiveness (n = 24); adoption (n = 5), implementation (n = 9), and maintenance (n = 1). Conclusions: mHealth can transition disease-centred services towards people-centred services. Critical appraisal of studies highlighted methodological issues, raising doubts about validity. The limited evidence for large-scale implementation and international variation in reporting of mHealth practice, modalities used, and health domains addressed requires capacity building. Information-enhanced implementation and evaluation of IPCHS, particularly for participatory governance and accountability, is also important. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","digital health; eHealth; integrated care; mHealth; mobile health; person-centred care; primary care","Australia; China; Health Services; Humans; Malaysia; New Zealand; Telemedicine; Cardiology; Diseases; mHealth; Service industry; Text messaging; Cardio-vascular disease; Low income countries; Medication adherence; Mobile applications; Mobile Health (M-Health); Scientific database; Smoking cessations; World Health Organization; asthma; Australia; behavior change; caregiver; China; diabetes mellitus; health care access; health care quality; heart failure; human; integrated health care system; integrated people centred health service; interpersonal communication; lifestyle; low income country; Malaysia; medication compliance; mobile application; mobile health; New Zealand; participatory management; point of care testing; priority journal; Review; safety; smoking cessation; systematic review; telehealth; text messaging; treatment outcome; World Health Organization; health service; telemedicine; Quality control","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089731712"

We assessed the uptake, feasibility and effectiveness of an mHealth intervention in improving the performance of village-based frontline workers, called accredited social health activists (ASHAs), to increase the coverage of maternal, newborn and child health services in rural India. Methods. A new mobile phone application - Innovative Mobile-phone Technology for Community Health Operations (ImTeCHO) - was implemented in all the 45 villages of two primary health centres in Jhagadia, Gujarat (population ~45 000), between August 2013 and February 2014 after training 45 ASHAs. After 9 months of implementation, 99 mothers of young infants between the ages of 1 and 4 months and 187 mothers of infants between the ages of 6 and 9 months were interviewed during the household survey to assess the coverage of maternal, newborn and child health services in the project and similar control villages. Fifteen ASHAs were purposively selected and interviewed. Results. The coverage of home-based newborn care (56% v. 10%), exclusive breastfeeding (44% v. 23%), care-seeking for maternal (77% v. 57%) and neonatal complications (78% v. 27%) and pneumonia (41% v. 24%) improved in the interventional area compared to the control area. The ASHAs logged into the mobile phone application on 88% of working days. Of a total of 10 774 forms required to be completed, the ASHAs completed 7710 forms. During the interviews, all ASHAs demonstrated sufficient competency to use ImTeCHO and expressed a high level of acceptability and utility of all components of the intervention. Conclusion. A high degree of acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness for the mHealth intervention among ASHAs was supported by its widespread use. © 2019 The National Medical Journal of India.","","Attitude of Health Personnel; Breast Feeding; Communication; Community Health Workers; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Feasibility Studies; Female; House Calls; Humans; Implementation Science; India; Infant; Male; Maternal-Child Health Services; Mobile Applications; Motivation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Perinatal Care; Postnatal Care; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Quality Improvement; Rural Population; Smartphone; breast feeding; clinical decision support system; controlled study; electronic health record; feasibility study; female; health auxiliary; health personnel attitude; home visit; human; India; infant; interpersonal communication; male; maternal child health care; mobile application; motivation; patient attitude; perinatal care; postnatal care; pregnancy; prenatal care; randomized controlled trial; rural population; smartphone; total quality management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091809779"

The implementation of digital health tools has suffered from 2 limitations: (1) the interventions commonly ignore the “law of amplification” that states that technology is most likely to succeed when it seeks to augment and not alter human behavior; and (2) end-user needs and clinical gaps are often poorly understood while designing solutions, contributing to a substantial decrease in usage, referred to as the “law of attrition” in eHealth. The COVID-19 pandemic has addressed the first of the 2 problems-technology solutions, such as telemedicine, that were struggling to find traction are now closely aligned with health-seeking behavior. The second problem (poorly designed solutions) persists, as demonstrated by a plethora of poorly designed epidemic prediction tools and digital contact-tracing apps, which were deployed at scale, around the world, with little validation. The pandemic has accelerated the Indian state's desire to build the nation's digital health ecosystem. We call for the inclusion of regulatory sandboxes, as successfully done in the fintech sector, to provide a real-world testing environment for mHealth solutions before deploying them at scale. © Abhishek Bhatia, Rahul Matthan, Tarun Khanna, Satchit Balsari.

While this is true across the world, the need is even more acute in emerging markets. For instance, there is only one dentist for every 150000 people in rural India. The objective of this project is to create a cost-effective, multimodal, personal oral sensing device that automatically classifies sensed data and provides interactive advice about oral health. Based on surveys of dentists and doctors about the types of information that would be useful, this paper presents POHA, a handheld home device that integrates image, video, smell, temperature, and 3D orientation sensing, and communicates with a Smartphone via USB and Bluetooth. POHA scans the mouth and teeth of a person while they perform a brushing-like motion. This research work developed image and smell classification models by training machine learning algorithms with hundreds of images collected from the web and air quality values of various mouth odors obtained with a low-cost gas sensor. Initial experiments show greater than 80% accuracy in detecting dental cavities, gingivitis, and bad breath. This project also involved developing a Smartphone application that provides users real-time views of sensed data, shows classification results and advice, collects health information, and stores tagged sensor data in a central cloud database. This first-of-its-kind device fits easily into one's daily routine, provides preventive advice, and encourages seeing a dentist or a doctor. POHA also provides doctors for the first time with tagged daily oral sensing data from millions of people that would be invaluable for medical research in detecting, preventing, and predicting numerous diseases that have oral manifestations. © 2019 IEEE.","affordable; Artificial Intelligence; caries; device; emerging markets; gingivitis; halitosis; healthcare; hygiene; mobile computing; mouth; real-time; sensing; systemic disease","Air quality; Classification (of information); Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Dentistry; Learning algorithms; mHealth; Rural areas; Smartphones; Classification models; Classification results; Emerging markets; Health informations; Medical research; Multi-modal sensing; Smart-phone applications; Training machines; Machine learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083655164"

The causes of this infectious disease could be attributed to viruses, bacteria or fungi. One of the many ways of detecting the disease is by a chest X-ray of the patient. The rural population in developing nations have limited access to doctors, medical diagnostic facilities, and hospitals. Hence, diagnosis is delayed resulting in adverse consequences. This paper is an attempt to design and develop a smartphone-based application (app) for the preliminary detection of pneumonia using X-ray images. The app is based on machine learning which identifies pneumonia, using a chest X-ray image of a patient with a 'MobileNets' model, trained on thousands of X-ray images of known cases of pneumonia. The app has been developed on Android Studio, incorporating TensorFlow library. The patient's chest X-ray is scanned and uploaded to the app using the smartphone camera. Additionally, an e-diagnosis facility is integrated into the app where qualified medical practitioners' advice is taken on the obtained results. A breathing pattern recorder module is developed, which, in future, could be integrated into the smartphone app to increase its accuracy in prediction. © 2019 IEEE.","breathing pattern; Machine Learning; MobileNets; pneumonia; TensorFlow; X-ray","Computer viruses; E-learning; Learning systems; Machine learning; mHealth; Pathology; Smartphones; Viruses; X rays; Breathing patterns; Medical diagnostics; Medical practitioner; Mobile applications; MobileNets; pneumonia; Smart-phone cameras; TensorFlow; Diagnosis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082667067"

It may give a drastic increase in the life expectancy of disabled people over the whole world especially the developing world. In order to meet the needs of elderly or disabled peoples' health care services, it is necessary to develop an effective assistive device that is cost-effective, affordable, and easy to use. The work is undertaken to develop a smart assistive device that combines sensor technology and telecommunication technology to enable the remote monitoring of disabled patients. The health care system is based on the Internet of Things (IoT) that makes disabled patients lead an independent life. When the person has whole or partial body movement impairments, they cannot express their needs to the physicians or care-takers, and moreover, they are unable to communicate like normal people. So they cannot manage their basic day-to-day activities like holding an object to eat, drink, or to do any activity. The assistive health care system thereby assists the patients as and when they receive SMS from the patient with the aid of the IoT network. Each and every slight movement of the patient fingers are converted into their corresponding needs. Also, it monitors the physiological vital parameters such as heartbeat, temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. The network will send a corresponding message to the physicians and it will display the needs on their mobile phone or display gadget. Thus this system makes it possible for the health care professional to track the patient and to provide distant care in case of an emergency. © 2020 School of Science, IHU.

A recent survey shows that the rate of vehicle accidents is widely increasing, due to rash driving like over speeding, not following traffic rules, etc. On proper time the provision of first-aid medical service can help in saving lives. Hence, there is a need for an application which detects and prevents vehicle accidents. The main goal of the system is to alert the nearby medical services about the accident so as to provide immediate medical aid. The application can make use of a sensor (accelerometer) in mobiles, to sense the tilt of the vehicle. Thus, the system will make the decision to alert the admin (owner of the vehicle or family members) and it will send the information through the mobile app. The Android application in the mobile phone will send text messages to the nearest medical services and family or vehicle owner.

These medical devices and applications are connected to healthcare systems through the Internet. The Wi-Fi enabled devices facilitate machine-to-machine communication and link to the cloud platforms for data storage. IoMT has the ability to make accurate diagnoses, with fewer mistakes and lower costs of care. IoMT with smartphone applications permits the patients to exchange their health related confidential and private information to the healthcare experts (i.e., doctors) for the better control of diseases, and also for tracking and preventing chronic illnesses. Due to insecure communication among the entities involved in IoMT, an attacker can tamper with the confidential and private health related information for example an attacker can not only intercept the messages, but can also modify, delete or insert malicious messages during communication. To deal this sensitive issue, we design a novel blockchain enabled authentication key agreement protocol for IoMT environment, called BAKMP-IoMT. BAKMP-IoMT provides secure key management between implantable medical devices and personal servers and between personal servers and cloud servers. The legitimate users can also access the healthcare data from the cloud servers in a secure way. The entire healthcare data is stored in a blockchain maintained by the cloud servers. A detailed formal security including the security verification of BAKMP-IoMT using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool is performed to demonstrate its resilience against the different types of possible attack. The comparison of BAKMP-IoMT with relevant existing schemes is conducted which identifies that the proposed system furnishes better security and functionality, and also needs low communication and computational costs as compared to other schemes. Finally, the simulation of BAKMP-IoMT is conducted to demonstrate its impact on the performance parameters. © 2013 IEEE.","authentication; Blockchain; Internet of Medical Things (IoMT); key management; security; simulation","Application programs; Blockchain; Cloud computing; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Disease control; Internet protocols; mHealth; Network security; Authentication key agreement protocols; Health related informations; Implantable medical devices; Key management protocols; Performance parameters; Security verification; Smart-phone applications; Software applications; Machine-to-machine communication","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086014000"

Today's Vehicle is need of everyone for moving one place to another. Together this, data security plays an important role in automation systems as critical user's (vehicle's user) data is moved to another user though internet with the help of wireless devices and routes which includes optical fiber, radio channels, etc. In fact, each and every device is connected to the internet and is linked to each other, thus forming the Internet of Things (IoT). As the network is moving towards wireless applications, many threats to vehicles (autonomous vehicles) are becoming a critical problem for vehicles users and service providers. A majority of these attacks can be spotted and detected with the hep of a number of intrusion detection techniques which were elucidated in the earlier decade. These techniques are highly efficient in the identification of any form of individual breaches into the system by catching hold of invalid data access. A few of the systems which need safety are an integral part of Wireless Networks which consist of WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks), WPANs (Wireless Personal Area Networks), etc. WPAN family further constitutes of three networks which are WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks), mobile phones and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification like On Board Units (OBUs)). Since digitization is taking place in each and every sector, i.e., defence, healthcare, education, automation industries etc., and so the threat to data also exist.

Right from basic road traffic information to contextual advertisements, they are promising to move beyond being mere apps, to making a greater impact in various domains, like urban planning for smart cities, indoor navigation, healthcare & emergency services, precision agriculture, vehicle fleet management, Internet-of-things etc. to name a few. In short, location and navigation are set to drive Industry 4.0 ahead. Upon a broad classification, the following major class of players emerge in the field of LBS: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) providers such as GPS, Galileo, Glonass and NavIC; ground system technology developers for reference stations, timing systems etc; user equipment manufacturers; and, end-application creators, which could be anything from a simple restaurant recommendation system to a drone-based last-mile connectivity for a complex supply-chain solution or a fully autonomous driver-less car. The aim of this paper is to carry out a detailed analysis of the present patent landscape of the key technologies of LBS and assist the above-mentioned stakeholders to identify potential collaborators. Also, the study will facilitate the relatively newer entrants in GNSS like NavIC, and the existing players like GPS in providing modernized services. Since patents showcase the future direction of research by the technology owners, a landscape study will give a stakeholder a big picture of their position within their spectrum of interest. Apart from being a resource to determine R&D strategies, a patent landscape will not only help the stakeholders partner with the right technology owners, but also prevent pitfalls like duplication of efforts, unprofitable research investments and importantly, potential patent infringements. Given the very broad spectrum of technologies that play major roles in LBS, the paper will divide the technologies into specific domains, analyse and provide insights into ownership of patents in each of the domains further categorized by International Patent Classification (IPC) system of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This will be of immense interest to not only private organizations, but also to the policymakers in defining their roadmap for research, technology and product development.

Ability to detect these symptoms heavily relies on accurate measurements of emotion and its components, such as emotional valence comprising of positive, negative and neutral affect. Speech as a bio-signal to measure valence is interesting because of the ubiquity of smartphones that can easily record and process speech signals. Speech-based emotion detection uses a broad spectrum of features derived from audio samples including pitch, energy, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients, Log frequency power coefficients, spectrograms and so on. Despite the array of features and classifiers, detecting valence from speech alone remains a challenge. Further, the algorithms for extracting some of these features are computeintensive. This becomes a problem particularly in smartphone applications where the algorithms have to be executed on the device itself. We propose a novel time-domain feature that not only improves the valence detection accuracy, but also saves 10% of the computational cost of extraction as compared to that of MFCCs. A Random Forest Regressor operating on the proposed feature-set detects speaker-independent valence on a non-acted database with 70% accuracy. The algorithm also achieves 100% accuracy when tested with the acted speech database, Emo-DB. © 2019 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Emotions; Humans; Speech; Continuous speech recognition; Decision trees; mHealth; Signal analysis; Smartphones; Speech; Speech communication; Time domain analysis; Accurate measurement; Computational costs; Detection accuracy; Linear predictive cepstral coefficients; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; Smart-phone applications; Speaker independents; Time domain features; algorithm; emotion; factual database; human; speech; Feature extraction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077854337"

Previous reviews have discussed methods used in postural assessment but none of them focused exclusively on mobile applications. This paper systematically reviews mobile applications proposed for analyzing human posture based on alignment of the body in the sagittal and coronal plane. The main digital libraries were searched, 26 articles published between 2010 and 2020 were selected, and 13 mobile applications were identified, classified and discussed. Results showed that the use of mobile applications to assist with posture assessment have been demonstrated to be reliable, and this can contribute to clinical practice of health professionals, especially the assessment and reassessment phases of treatments, despite some variations when compared to traditional methods. Moreover, in the case of image-based applications, we highlight the advantage that measurements can be taken with the assessor at a certain distance with respect to the patient’s position, which is an important function for assessments performed in pandemic times such as the outbreak of COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

Dynamic physiological activities are such a key metric that they are perceived by means of measuring galvanic skin response (GSR). GSR represents impedance of human skin that frequently changes based on different human respiratory and physical instability. Existing solutions, paved in literature and market, focus on the direct measurement of GSR by two sensor-attached leads, which are then parameterized against the standard printed circuit board mechanism. This process is sometimes cumbersome to use, resulting in lower user experience provisioning and adaptability in livelihood activities. The purpose of this study is to validate the novel development of the cost-effective GSR sensing system for affective usage for smart e-healthcare. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes to design and develop a flexible circuit strip, populated with essential circuitry assemblies, to assess and monitor the level of GSR. Ordinarily, this flexible system would be worn on the back palm of the hand where two leads would contact two sensor strips worn on the first finger. Findings: The system was developed on top of Pyralux. Initial goals of this work are to design and validate a flexible film-based GSR system to detect an individual’s level of human physiological activities by acquiring, amplifying and processing GSR data. The measured GSR value is visualized “24 × 7” on a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone via a pre-incorporated application. Conclusion: The proposed sensor-system is capable of raising the qualities such as adaptability, user experience, portability and ubiquity for possible application of monitoring of human psychodynamics in a more cost-effective way, i.e. less than US$50. Practical implications: Several novel attributes are envisaged in the development process of the GSR system that made it different from and unique as compared to the existing alternatives. The attributes are as follows: (i) use of reproductive sensor-system fabrication process, (ii) use of flexible-substrate for hosting the system as proof of concept, (iii) use of miniaturized microcontroller, i.e. ATTiny85, (iv) deployment of energy-efficient passive electrical circuitry for noise filtering, (v) possible use case scenario of using CR2032 coin battery for provisioning powering up the system, (vi) provision of incorporation of internet of things (IoT)-cloud integration in existing version while fixing related APIs and (vii) incorporation of heterogeneous software-based solutions to validate and monitor the GSR output such as MakerPlot, Arduino IDE, Fritzing and MIT App Inventor 2. Originality/value: This paper is a revised version R1 of the earlier reviewed paper. The proposed paper provides novel knowledge about the flexible sensor system development for GSR monitoring under IoT-based environment for smart e-healthcare. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Biosensors; e-Health; GSR; IoT; Physiological factor; sensors; Wearable","Application programs; Biosensors; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Electrophysiology; Energy efficiency; Filtration; Flexible electronics; mHealth; Physiological models; Printed circuit boards; Sensors; Substrates; User experience; Wearable sensors; Design/methodology/approach; Development process; Galvanic skin response; Heterogeneous software; Internet of Things (IOT); Physiological activity; Physiological factors; Wearable; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067316438"

To guide scale-up and optimize programmatic implementation, we conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. Methods: The COMmunity Home Based INDia (COMBIND) study, was conducted in four districts of Maharashtra, India and randomized 119 integrated counseling and testing centers (ICTC) and their outreach workers (ORWs) to the COMBIND intervention, an integrated mHealth application that allowed digital data capture, PMTCT educational videos, SMS alerts for missed visits and reminder for visits, combined with personal empowerment and motivational interviewing training for ORWs. This qualitative evaluation was done through 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with ORWs and 15 IDIs with HIV-infected pregnant/breastfeeding women from the intervention arm. Utilizing a concurrent nested mixed-method evaluation approach, we assess the feasibility and acceptability of the study intervention. Results: All 30 participants reported that the PMTCT videos were essential in providing easy to understand information on critical aspects of HIV and necessary care related to PMTCT practices. A majority of the ORWs reported that the personal empowerment training with motivational interviewing skills training increased their confidence, motivation and gave them the tools for effectively supporting their clients. The mHealth application improved their working style as it facilitated targeted PMTCT information support, systemized data capture, streamlined their health education delivery practice and provided a sense of work satisfaction. The SMS appointment alerts improved retention in HIV care for mother and baby to the smaller proportion that had access to their phones. Despite reported improvements in knowledge and communication, few ORWs reported that structural challenges such as limited drug stocks, lack of HIV kits or unavailability of trained staff at ICTC, may hamper the uptake of PMTCT services, thus resulting in limited significant impacts of COMBIND on PMTCT outcomes. Conclusion: This study found that COMBIND intervention is scalable, feasible, beneficial and very well accepted by ORWs and patients, however structural challenges in goods and services remain. © 2020 The Author(s).","HIV; Intervention; Mhealth; Option B +; PMTCT","Adult; Counseling; Feasibility Studies; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; India; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Middle Aged; Mothers; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnant Women; Telemedicine; adult; counseling; feasibility study; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; India; middle aged; mother; organization and management; patient attitude; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnant woman; prevention and control; psychology; telemedicine; vertical transmission","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085365461"

The shortage of trained ophthalmologists, limited availability of healthcare centers, and expensiveness of diagnostic equipment are among the reasons. Although many deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy techniques have been implemented in the literature, these methods still fail to provide a point-of-care diagnosis, and this raises the need for an independent diagnostic of diabetic retinopathy that can be used by a non-expert. Recently the usage of smartphones has been increasing across the world; automated diagnoses of diabetic retinopathy can be deployed on smartphones in order to provide an instant diagnosis to diabetic people residing in remote areas. In this paper, inception based convolutional neural network and binary decision tree-based ensemble of classifiers have been proposed and implemented to detect and classify diabetic retinopathy.

With the view of eliminating undesired maintenance costs and production loss, condition monitoring has been adopted in different sectors. For predicting the life of different machine components a method called 'Machine Fault Diagnostics and Condition Monitoring using Augmented Reality and Internet of Things' is proposed here. The main objective of the method proposed here is to diagnose a machine and its parts by monitoring different parameters like temperature, pressure, speed, vibration noise etc., to predict overheating, wear and tear or any other kinds of defects. The values of these parameters will be taken to analyze the working conditions of different machine components and finally to predict their life. IoT has its importance in making the machines connected by employing sensors which are mounted onto the machine parts for collecting data from them. Sensors like temperature sensors, pressure sensors, vibration sensors, proximity sensors etc., are most commonly used for condition monitoring. Machine parts that can be taken for monitoring may include gearbox, engine parts or even any kinds of pumps can be used. Data collected will be deployed to cloud servers like Thingspeak or MQTT Broker for further analysis in the future. Thingspeak with the assistance of Mathlab, allows visualization of data. These data will be taken and visualized using augmented reality in any devices like hololens, tablets or smartphones by buiding an android application with the help of a developing environment called Unity. The users will be able to see a visual overlay of the collected data which gives the health information of the machines that help them to infer whether a component is to be replaced or not. Thus continuous evaluation is made possible and minute defects can be detected before the occurrence of a catastrophic breakdown.

Data networks in the developing world have been an important part of health-care systems. Moreover, due to a growth in population, the journey of the patient across the multiple routes in the healthcare system would highly challenge the accountability, tracking, recording, and analysis of patient data. Developing a model for gathering patient medical information from various health care contexts (i.e., family physicians, private clinics, emergency department visits, social service routes, and hospital systems) is essential, and requires more space to store all patient data. The cloud database is an efficient solution to implement this application and it consists of various services like authentication, storage, and cloud messaging. The users are authenticated and then the user data is maintained in a centralized manner via cloud services. This research work also incorporates a Quick Response (QR code) to access patient-specific medical data through a smart card in the smartphone. The smart card will serve as a sharing media with other health care providers and facilitated decision making. It helps to make good decisions before treatment by checking previous medical records of the patient. © 2020 IEEE.","Cloud; Decision Making; Medical Records; QR Code; Smart Card","Android (operating system); Authentication; Decision making; Developing countries; Digital storage; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; mHealth; Patient treatment; Population statistics; Smart cards; Storage as a service (STaaS); Android applications; Developing world; Emergency departments; Health care providers; Health-care system; Medical information; Multiple routes; Patient specific; Medical information systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092053334"

Framingham Heart Study Group in Boston developed, the very first 10-year CVD risk prediction model. The WHO recently derived a 10-year risk prediction model, for fatal and non-fatal CVD events using individual participant data, from the Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration. This CVD risk model, derivation involved participation of 376,177 individuals from 85 cohorts, and 19,333 incident CVD events. Cardiometabolic diseases in general, and metabolic diseases like hypertension, excess weight, obesity, type-2 diabetes, and vascular diseases collectively, contribute to the overall morbidity and mortality related to CVDs. Of the 18 million CVD-related deaths in 2017, more than three quarters were in low-income and middle-income countries. Risk stratification, management, and prevention models can be very important components of disease prevention and control efforts. In view of this very important role the risk assessment plays, we have reviewed and discussed three specific areas of integration of emerging diagnostic technologies,-population level, individual level, and novel ways of collecting, collating, derivation, and validation of individual risks, risk scores for cluster of risks, and for the use of such data for treatment management. For collection of massive data from general population, we have discussed the National Institutes of Health’s flagship program,-All of Us. For empowering individuals in risk assessment and management of identified risks, we have discussed ambulatory diagnostic devices, blood pressure monitors, and continuous glucose monitors. As an example of futuristic approach for the integration of diagnostic tools, we have discussed the products developed by LD-Technologies, Miami, Florida by Dr. Albert Maarek and associates. There are thousands of mHealth apps available for download, and not all are of great use in developing, a seamless diagnostic platform, that we at AayuSmart are trying to put together for cardiometabolic risk stratification, risk prediction, and risk management. We have provided, just a brief glimpse of available tracking, computing, collating, and the software analytical capabilities that exists, and discussed how innovators are trying to use them to build novel diagnostic tools. Despite the important role of telemedicine and internet of things (IOT) in disease management, and healthcare delivery, we have not discussed those applications. In this overview, we have discussed the use of emerging diagnostic tools, for obtaining data at the population level, personal level, as well as for clinical settings. Having said that, we must inform the readers, that there is a great difference between the consumer devices (wrist-worn activity trackers), medical devices (FDA cleared or CE Marked), and a variety of technologies that are in use, but not yet considered clinical testing devices. © 2020, International Medical Research and Development Corporation.

Identifying and targeting individuals at high risk, is essential for preventing T2D. Several studies point to mobile health initiatives delivered through personal smart devices being a promising approach to diabetes prevention, through weight loss. The aim of the mobile health and diabetes (mDiab) trial was twofold: to achieve 5% weight loss and to look at the association of weight loss with degree of engagement with the mDiab app. Methods: The mDiab randomized control trial was carried out among smartphone users who are at high risk for T2D mellitus in three cities - Chennai, Bengaluru, and New Delhi in India. The intervention was delivered through a mobile phone application along with weekly coach calls for 12 weeks. While individuals in the intervention group individuals received the app, which enabled tracking their weight, physical activity, and diet along with 12 weekly video lessons on T2D prevention and coach calls, the control group received usual care. Results: The intervention group experienced a significant 1 kg weight loss while the control group lost 0.3 kg (P < 0.05). More individuals in the intervention group (n = 139, 15%) met the 5% weight loss target than in the control group (n = 131, 9%). In the intervention group those who viewed the videos experienced greater weight loss (2.4 kg) than those who only attended coach calls (0.9 kg) (P < 0.01). Conclusions: An mHealth intervention helped to achieve moderate weight loss. Future studies should explore the sustainability of this weight loss. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Diabetes prevention; mHealth; Weight loss","Adult; Cell Phone; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet; Exercise; Female; Humans; India; Male; Mobile Applications; Patient Participation; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; Weight Reduction Programs; adult; Article; behavior change; body weight loss; controlled study; educational status; employment status; female; high risk population; human; India; major clinical study; male; mobile application; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physical activity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; videorecording; body weight loss; diet; exercise; mobile application; mobile phone; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient participation; procedures; telemedicine; treatment outcome; weight loss program","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071165739"

The Government of India, State governments, and healthcare organizations have developed various mobile apps for the containment of COVID-19. This study was aimed to systematically review COVID-19 related mobile apps and highlight gaps to inform the development of future mHealth initiatives. Methods: Google Play and the Apple app stores were searched using the terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', and 'epidemic' in the first week of April 2020. A list of COVID-19-specific functions was compiled based on the review of the selected apps, the literature on epidemic surveillance, and national and international media reports. The World Health Organization guideline on Digital Health Interventions was used to classify the app functions under the categories of the general public, health workers, health system managers, and data services. Results: The search yielded 346 potential COVID-19 apps, of which 50 met the inclusion criteria. Dissemination of untargeted COVID-19-related information on preventative strategies and monitoring the movements of quarantined individuals was the function of 27 (54%) and 19 (32%) apps, respectively. Eight (16%) apps had a contact tracing and hotspot identification function. Interpretation & conclusions: Our study highlights the current emphasis on the development of self-testing, quarantine monitoring, and contact tracing apps. India's response to COVID-19 can be strengthened by developing comprehensive mHealth solutions for frontline healthcare workers, rapid response teams and public health authorities. Among this unprecedented global health emergency, the Governments must ensure the necessary but least intrusive measures for disease surveillance.

Its application spans from environment security to nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) attacks, brain-machine interface to medical and biochip integrated mobile phones to smart manufacturing. However, in wireless communication, the wireless link is weak as it introduces impairment. Recently, Weibull-Gamma (WG) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) are proposed as fading and noise model respectively for NC. In this paper, we propose closedform expressions for error rate over WG fading under Selection Combining (SC) scheme in the presence of GGD noise to improve the performance of the system. In particular, closed-form expressions for BER of BPSK and MPAM modulation schemes are derived over WG fading in the presence of GGD noise. It is noticeable that GGD noise includes various noises, such as Laplacian, Gaussian distribution and uniform distribution as it's a special case. Therefore, proposed expressions are general in nature and in different special cases are analyzed numerically. Further, the dual SC diversity scheme shows significant performance improvement. Also, the results are numerically compared with those presented in the literature. © 2020 by Begell House, Inc.","BER; Fading channel; Generalized Gaussian distribution; Modulation; Nano communication","Biochips; Brain computer interface; Gaussian distribution; mHealth; Weibull distribution; Brain machine interface; Closed-form expression; Generalized Gaussian distribution; Nano communications; Nuclear , biological and chemicals; Smart manufacturing; Uniform distribution; Wireless communications; Gaussian noise (electronic)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092788886"

Mobile health (mHealth) apps provide an innovative platform for delivering tailored HIV prevention and care among these populations more efficiently than possible through the direct face-to-face approach. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the role of a peer-customized mobile app based on the principle of self-learning for improving HIV prevention knowledge and access to health services among men who have sex with men, transgender women (known as Waria in Indonesia), and people who use drugs in Indonesia. Methods: A prospective intervention cohort study was conducted among the key populations in five provinces of Indonesia (Jakarata, West Java, East Java, Special Region of Yogyakarta, and Bali). The data were evaluated using a pre-post assessment survey conducted on a sample of 200 unique users, including 50 men who have sex with men and transgender women each, and 100 people who use drugs, with a follow-up response rate of 98% and 70%, respectively. An mHealth app named RUMAH SELA was developed and implemented among the key populations. Results: From baseline to the endpoint of the study, there was a significant increase in comprehensive HIV-related knowledge from 20% (10/49) to 60% (29/49), 22% (11/49) to 57% (28/49), and 49% (34/70) to 74% (52/70) among men who have sex with men (P=.004), transgender women (P<.001), and people who use drugs (P<.001), respectively. There was also a reduction in sexual activities without condom use from 22% (11/49) to 19% (9/49), 18% (9/49) to 12% (6/49), and 21% (15/70) to 10% (7/70) among men who have sex with men (P=.45), transgender women (P=.25), and people who use drugs (P<.001), respectively. There was an uptake of HIV testing by 31% (15/49) for men who have sex with men, 49% (24/49) for transgender women, and 26% (18/70) for people who use drugs after using the app. There was a reduction in injecting drugs with a used needle in drug users from 45/70 (78%) to 15/70 (26%). Measures of self-esteem increased among men who have sex with men (mean 26.4 vs mean 27.1), transgender women (mean 26.5 vs mean 27.8; P=.02), and people who use drugs (mean 24.0 vs mean 25.0). In addition, 27% (7/24) of men who have sex with men, 25% (4/15) of transgender women, and 11% (2/18) of drug users made an appointment for an HIV test through the app. The app was quite highly accepted by the key populations as nearly a quarter felt that they became more confident in discussing issues about sexuality, more than 80% found that the app provided sufficient knowledge about HIV, and more than half of the participants found the app to be user friendly. Conclusions: This one-of-a-kind mHealth intervention with an mHealth app as a self-learning tool is effective in increasing HIV-related knowledge and behavior, and access to services with strong acceptability by the community. There is a need to scale up such interventions for efficacy testing in a larger population to provide evidence for national-level mHealth programs addressing HIV.  © 2020 Priyanka Rani Garg, Leena Uppal, Sunil Mehra, Devika Mehra.","HIV; Indonesia; Key populations; mHealth","Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Mobile Applications; Prospective Studies; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Telemedicine; Young Adult; adult; cohort analysis; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Indonesia; male; male homosexuality; mobile application; prospective study; sexual and gender minority; telemedicine; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090493989"

However, the high fabrication cost of these sensors along with the unreliable front-end processing of data restricts their widespread usage. In this report, we demonstrate MoS2 growth on Al foil which was further integrated onto eraser substrate to develop smart, low-cost motion sensors (pedometer and gesture communication) and a breath sensor by measuring physiological parameters such as strain, touch and hydration levels of lungs, respectively. The data generated are wirelessly transmitted to the smartphone via Bluetooth and analyzed using dedicated Android applications for individual sensing displays. For the pedometer, the fabricated sensor was integrated onto the knee which could then calculate the steps taken, distance covered, speed and approximate number of calories burned by the individual. Gesture communication helps deaf/dumb/paralyzed individuals to communicate with the external environment using finger movements. Breath sensing allows for the early detection of lung diseases by monitoring the hydration levels of the lungs. Furthermore, the piezotronic effect of MoS2 on breath sensing was systematically studied, and a 56.8% increase in the response was observed under a 16% strain. The sensing mechanism for each stimulus is explained via modulation in the charge transport properties for each stimulus. The sensor exhibited excellent durability where the device performance was found to be stable even after 500 continuous bending cycles. The successful demonstration of such low-cost functional wireless personal healthcare monitoring systems for Internet of Things applications is a major step forward in flexible and wearable electronics. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","breath sensor; gesture communication; MoS<sub>2</sub>                             ; pedometer; personal healthcare; smart sensors","Costs; Data handling; Flexible electronics; Hydration; Layered semiconductors; mHealth; Molybdenum compounds; Monitoring; Physiological models; Smart sensors; Smartphones; Sulfur compounds; Android applications; Breath sensors; External environments; Front-end processing; MoS2; pedometer; Personal health care; Physiological parameters; Wearable sensors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070648845"

Assessment of human exposure to pollutants for the epidemiological studies will be one of the subsidiary objectives of data analytics for precision medicine forecast for the individuals in the industrially polluted region. The objective of the research determines whether to estimate personal air pollution exposure or population exposure. The exposure can be long term and short term. It includes indoor and outdoor. Direct methods like personal monitoring by using smart phones, air pollution sensors are accurate but quite expensive for huge populations. Indirect methods incorporate information gained from questionnaires accompanied by measured pollutants from the monitoring sites. Lean on the nature of analysis, the assessment pattern may vary. This paper discusses most popular air pollution assessment methods applied in the epidemiological studies related to air pollution. Recent trends in epidemiological studies led to the development of air pollution exposure assessment models that rely on satellite measurement of pollutants. Usage of geographic information system for exposure assessment demands spatial analysis. Mobile applications and sensor technology equipment for personal exposure assessment are promising methods in this study. The articles discussed in this study also observes the method of measurement of each pollutant exposure to individuals by geocoding the addresses with the average pollutant concentration measured at fixed site stations. © 2020 The Authors.

Public area network is used to send data to cloud from healthcare devices, which is not secure. Opponent could read and change the data in the network during transmission. However, due to the heterogeneity, different characteristics and small size of smart wearable devices, specific method for the data protection with wearable device has not been yet established. Therefore to protect the privacy of patient's data it needed access control mechanism based on encryption and cryptography. In this article, we review the different models, schemes as well as implementation related to data encryption and cryptography algorithms proposed by different researchers to secure smart wearable medical health care devices.

Nowadays, the enhancement of the mobile applications namely IoTApps and their exploitation in various domains like healthcare monitoring, home automation, smart farming, smart grid, and smart city are crucial. Though mobile devices are providing seamless user experience anywhere, anytime, and anyplace, their restricted resources such as limited battery capacity, constrained processor speed, inadequate storage, and memory are hindering the development of resource-intensive mobile applications and internet of things (IoT)-based mobile applications. To solve this resource constraint problem, a web service-based IoT framework is proposed by exploiting fuzzy logic methodologies. This framework augments the resources of mobile devices by offloading the resource-intensive subtasks from mobile devices to the service providing entities like Arduino, Raspberry PI controller, edge cloud, and distant cloud. Based on the recommended framework, an online Repository of Instructional Talk (RIoTalk) is successfully implemented to store and analyze the classroom lectures given by faculty in our study site. Simulation results show that there is a significant reduction in energy consumption, execution time, bandwidth utilization, and latency. The proposed research work significantly increases the resources of mobile devices by offloading the resource-intensive subtasks from the mobile device to the service provider computing entities thereby providing Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) to mobile users. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","edge cloud; fog computing; fuzzy logic; IoT app; mobile edge computing; mobile resource augmentation framework","Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Internet of things; Internet service providers; mHealth; Mobile computing; Quality of service; User experience; Websites; Band-width utilization; Communication tools; Fuzzy logic methodology; Healthcare monitoring; Internet of Things (IOT); Quality of experience (QoE); Reduction in energy consumption; Resource constraint problems; Web services","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088065156"

Using commercially available smartphones and smartwatches, technology now affords opportunities to capture real-time and longitudinal profiles of patients' symptoms, cognition, physiology and social patterns. This novel data makes it possible to explore relationships between behaviours, physiology and symptoms, which may yield personalised relapse signals. Aims Smartphone Health Assessment for Relapse Prevention (SHARP), an international mental health research study supported by the Wellcome Trust, will inform the development of a scalable and sharable digital health solution to monitor personal risk of relapse. The resulting technology will be studied toward predicting and preventing relapse among individuals diagnosed with serious mental illness. Method SHARP is a two-phase study with research sites in Boston, Massachusetts, and Bangalore and Bhopal, India. During phase 1, focus groups will be conducted at each study site to collect feedback on the design and features available on mindLAMP, a digital health platform. Individuals with serious mental illness will use mindLAMP for the duration of a year during phase 2. Results The results of the research outlined in this protocol will guide the development of technology and digital tools to help address pervasive challenges in global mental health. Conclusions The digital tools developed as a result of this study, and participants' experiences using them, may offer insight into opportunities to expand digital mental health resources and optimize their utilisation around the world.

The increased use of wireless devices across a variety of settings, from smart buildings to smart homes, energy consumption monitoring, healthcare applications, plus a myriad of mobile devices' applications worldwide have multiplied the already crowded radio spectrum anywhere causing problems. Hence, interference among concurrent transmissions causes severe performance degradation due to the coexistence of different wireless networks working on the very same frequency band, something which has an impact on the different applications' performance. The WSN working on the 2.4GHz frequency band experience interference from competing networks like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b/g) and also gets negatively influenced by applications like microwave oven and cordless phone. Because of said interference, the performance of the WSN is getting degraded. Furthermore, the operation of low power WSN is extremely vulnerable and unpredictable under interference conditions. Hence there is an increasing need for research on interference avoiding methods and on improving the coexistence mechanisms among different wireless devices operating on the same frequency band. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the important aspects of experimental analysis, estimation, modeling, and avoiding of interference for WSN and offers some insight in dealing with aforementioned problem. © 2020 School of Science, IHU.","Bluetooth; Data communication; Interference, 2.4 GHz frequency and; Wi-Fi; Wireless sensor networks; ZigBee","Automation; Energy utilization; IEEE Standards; Information services; Intelligent buildings; mHealth; Wi-Fi; Concurrent transmission; Energy consumption monitoring; Experimental analysis; Health care application; Information networks; Interference avoiding; Interference condition; Performance degradation; Wireless sensor networks","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088477032"

Location Based Services (LBS) in healthcare has been widely used to deliver detailed information like availability of health care facility, finding location, navigation and etc. However, in some places, the use of LBS in healthcare is limited because of lack of resources or information for getting timely information to users or patients who need health care services. The problem that can be detected is that the vital information needed by the patients or users such as the availability of health care facilities like pharmacy, hospital, clinic, blood bank, etc. has to be seamlessly reached. This work focus to solve the problem by creating a application for patients to get the information about nearest health care facilities by using any android based mobile phone. The proposed system uses composite algorithm. Composite algorithm comprises of three algorithms namely, Information Retrieval R-Tree (IR2) algorithm for filtering process, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) query Technique for path and distance verification and Ahuja- Dijkstras algorithm to find optimized path. The information have taken from the Google web server (real time data) by using Google API, We have collected more than 1000 data pertaining to healthcare facilities like longitude latitude, speciality, contact details and etc. This system was developed by Android OS.

Different countries have different regulations to limit the radiation density levels caused by these devices. The radiation absorbed by an individual depends on various factors such as the device they use, the proximity of use, the type of antenna, the relative orientation of the antenna on the device, and many more. Several standards exist which have tried to quantify the radiation levels and come up with safe limits of EMR absorption to prevent human harm. In this work, we determine the radiation concern levels in several scenarios using a handheld radiation meter by correlating the findings with several international standards, which are determined based on thorough scientific evidence. This study also analyzes the EMR from common devices used in day to day life such as smartphones, laptops, Wi-Fi routers, hotspots, wireless earphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers and other wireless accessories using a handheld radio frequency radiation measurement device. The procedure followed in this paper is so detailed that it can also be utilized by the general public as a tutorial to evaluate their own safety with respect to EMR exposure. We present a summary of the most prominent health hazards which have been known to occur due to EMR exposure. We also discuss some individual and collective human-centric protective and preventive measures that can be undertaken to reduce the risk of EMR absorption.

AR is a prominent research area in many applications, such as elderly care, security and surveillance, smart homes, health and fitness. Extremely Randomized Trees Classifier (ET Classifier) is a type of ensemble learning technique used in Activity Recognition, which clusters several different decision trees into a forest from a single learning set and gives the classification result. But it suffers from high variance and over-fitting problem due to high inter-dependency among hyperparameters during model building. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this paper is to propose a novel Random_Split_Point procedure for Extra tree classifier to make the existing approach more robust, less variance, less computational time in obtaining optimal split points and faster in model building. This approach generates K random split points from all the candidate features of the dataset and selects the best split point based on the maximum score obtained by information gain measure. METHODS: In the proposed method to improve the randomization and accuracy of AR system, a novel random split-point procedure for ET classifier is proposed. This approach reduces the bias-variance problem induced due to the three hyperparameters such as K, nmin and M used in split-point procedure of existing ET classifier (K: number of randomly selected attributes at each node, nmin: minimum sample size for splitting a node, M: number of decision trees for ensemble). This approach generates K random split points from all the candidate features of the dataset and selects the best split point based on the maximum score obtained by information gain measure. RESULTS: The proposed approach is experimented with two public AR datasets HAR and HAPT (UCI Machine Learning Repository) containing 6 and 12 activities respectively. In HAR dataset, smartphone sensed sensor signals of 3 static and 3 dynamic human daily activities are there, where as in HAPT dataset apart from these 6 daily activities, 6 postural transitions data is available. Experimental results and comparative analysis show that the proposed method outperforms over other existing techniques with an accuracy of 94.16% for HAR dataset and 92.63% for HAPT dataset. It also takes less computational time in finding optimal split-points and less model building time. CONCLUSION: AR systems can be used as an intelligent system in healthcare to monitor the behaviour of healthy people by recognizing their daily activities. These systems also help in early detection of some chronic diseases and improve the quality of life. In this paper, an attempt is made to improve the accuracy of Activity Recognition over some existing methods. © 2020 B Padmaja et al., licensed to EAI.","Activity Recognition; Extremely Randomized Tree Ensemble Method; Random Split Point; Sensors; Smartphone","Automation; Decision trees; Forestry; Home health care; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; mHealth; Model buildings; Pattern recognition; Activity recognition; Classification results; Comparative analysis; Daily life activities; Human activity recognition; Over fitting problem; Security and surveillances; UCI machine learning repository; Learning systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089839710"

This paper studies the use of the Whatsapp messenger as a platform for integrating the Spine care services in the Sultanate of Oman by streamlining the referral patterns to tertiary care centers. Materials and methods: In January 2015, a Whatsapp group was created including representatives of spine units from all 8 regional hospitals in Oman including Spine Consultants from tertiary care spine center in the country- Khoula Hospital. The referral data for 2 years and 9 months was retrospectively retrieved and analysed to determine the response time and treatment plans proposed for each case. They were compared with the available data of 2014. Results: 452 cases were referred using this platform during the study period. Forty percent of these were accepted and about 25% were advised to be treated conservatively at the referring hospital itself. The time to response reduced dramatically from over 12 h to a mean of one hour and 45 min as a result of this change. Discussion: The Whatsapp messenger platform appears to be an effective tool for inter-hospital referral based on clinical data and imaging studies and to obtain rapid responses from the referee center.

It could prevent nearly half of all diarrhea episodes and one-third of respiratory infections. It could also improve the IQ of child. Despite of such enormous benefits, compliance to breastfeeding is abysmally low in not only developing countries but also developed countries. There are many misconceptions about breastfeeding that prevent mothers from complying with optimal breastfeeding practices. These misconceptions arise out of incomplete information or outdated traditional practices. To address these concerns, collaborative work was undertaken by MBPC, BPNI Maharashtra, Department of Community Medicine-Seth G.S. Medical College KEM Hospital (Mumbai) and TATA Consultancy Services (TCS).These collaborative efforts have resulted in development of 'ShishuPoshan', mobile based application for the mothers. This application addresses almost all the queries that a lactating mother may have in a simple yet lucid and comprehensive way. In this case-study paper we will discuss about our learnings, experiences, journey in developing the ShishuPoshan application and various other aspects like the collaborative effort, the best practices followed, the lessons learnt, application beneficiaries, its impact and the way forward.

The analytical investigation using circuit theory concepts and the cavity model of the antenna is presented to validate the design. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a wearable antenna with wide impedance bandwidth of 118.68 % (2.96-11.6 GHz) applicable for UWB range of 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. The results present a maximum gain of 5.47 dBi at 7.3 GHz frequency. Moreover, this antenna exhibits Omni and quasi-Omni radiation patterns at various frequencies (4 GHz, 7 GHz and 10 GHz) for short-distance communication. The cutting notch and slot on the patch, and its effect on the antenna impedance to increase performance through current distribution is also presented. The time-domain characteristic of the proposed antenna is also discussed for the analysis of the pulse distortion phenomena. A constant group delay less than 1 ns is obtained over the entire operating impedance bandwidth (2.96-11.6 GHz) of the textile antenna in both situations, i.e., side by side and front to front. Linear phase consideration is also presented for both situations, as well as configurations of reception and transmission. An assessment of the effects of bending and humidity has been demonstrated by placing the antenna on the human body. The specific absorption rate (SAR) value was tested to show the radiation effect on the human body, and it was found that its impact on the human body SAR value is 1.68 W/kg, which indicates the safer limit to avoid radiation effects. Therefore, the proposed method is promising for telemedicine and mobile health systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Circuit theory; Frequency domain; SAR; Textile antenna; Time domain; Ultra-wideband","Bandwidth; Biological radiation effects; Circuit theory; Directional patterns (antenna); Electric impedance; Electromagnetic field effects; Group delay; mHealth; Microwave antennas; Slot antennas; Telemedicine; Textile industry; Textiles; Time domain analysis; Wearable antennas; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Analytical investigations; Frequency of operation; Short distance communications; Specific absorption rate; Time domain characteristics; Ultra-wideband antennas; Wide impedance bandwidths; Wireless body area network; Ultra-wideband (UWB)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087508554"

The objective of this study is to identify the most significant predictors influencing behavioural intention to use pregnancy apps. To meet this objective, a conceptual model was developed and empirically tested by extending UTAUT with relevant constructs namely personal innovativeness in IT and perceived risk. A conceptual model along with the hypothesized causal paths among the constructs are empirically validated with the help of structural equation modeling using Smart PLS 3.0 with a sample of 220 pregnant women. Results showed that intention to use pregnancy apps by women was predicted by six influencing factors: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, personal innovativeness and attitude.

A large Disease-Symptom graph is stored in the cloud and accessed using mobile devices over the Internet. Query and search are the fundamental operations of graph databases. However, while searching the Disease-Symptom graph for making preliminary diagnosis of diseases, queries become complex due to the complex structure of data and also queries are too hard to write and interpret. Moreover, it is not possible to access the graph frequently due to limited bandwidth of the network, transmission delay, and higher cost. Subgraph generation or pruning algorithm for appropriate inputs is one of the solutions to this problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient pruning algorithm by introducing a new approach to decompose the Disease-Symptom graph into a series of symptom trees (ST). All the Symptom trees are merged to build a pruned subgraph which is our requirement. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our pruning algorithm both analytically and empirically and validate on Disease-Symptom graph database, as well as other real graph databases.

To fill the existing research gaps, this study endeavours to develop a model for mHealth application selection by adopting a combined approach of AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS. The hierarchical model has been developed using factors identified from literature review and expert opinions. The ambiguity in comparing different mHealth applications has been handled by applying fuzzy set theory. The AHP has been used to determine the weights of criteria and sub-criteria, and the fuzzy-TOPSIS method has been used to obtain the final ranking of the applications. The applicability of the proposed model has been discussed through a numerical case example. The sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the weights of the criteria. In this study, user satisfaction, functionality, easy to learn and use, and information quality, have come out as important factors in mHealth application selection.

A service provider (SP) offers several services that are accessible through smart applications from any time, anywhere, and any place via the Internet. Due to the open nature of mobile communication and the Internet, these services are extremely susceptible to various malicious attacks, e.g., unauthorized access from malicious intruders. Therefore, to overcome these susceptibilities, a robust authentication scheme is the finest solution. In this article, we introduce a lightweight identity-based remote user authentication and key agreement scheme for IoT environment that enables secure access to IoT services. Our introduced scheme utilizes lightweight elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), hash operations, and XOR operations. The theoretical analysis and formal proof are presented to demonstrate that our scheme provides resistance against several security attacks. Performance evaluation and comparison of our scheme with several related schemes for IoT environment are carried out using the PyCrypto library in Ubuntu and mobile devices. The performance analysis shows that our scheme has trivial storage and communication cost. Hence, the devised scheme is more efficient not only in terms of storage, communication, and computation overheads but also in terms of providing sufficient security against various malicious attacks.  © 2020 Akasha Shafiq et al.","","Authentication; mHealth; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Public key cryptography; Service industry; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication scheme; Computation overheads; Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC); Internet of thing (IOT); Mobile communications; Performance analysis; Remote user authentication; Unauthorized access; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092616166"

However, it is necessary to assess end-user perceptions regarding mobile health interventions prior to its implementation. This would throw light on the acceptability of mobile phone communication in bringing about behavioral changes among the target Indonesian population. The aim of this study was to explore the perceived usefulness of receiving a potential smoking cessation intervention via mobile phones. Methods: This is an exploratory cross-sectional study involving current and former adult tobacco smokers residing in Indonesia. Online advertisement and snowballing were used to recruit respondents. Data was collected using a web-based survey over a period of 4 weeks. Those willing to participate signed an online consent and were subsequently directed to the online questionnaire that obtained demographics, tobacco usage patterns, perceived usefulness of a mobile phone smoking cessation application and its design. Results: A total of 161 people who smoked tobacco responded to the online survey. The mean age of the participants was 29.4. Of the 123 respondents, 102 were men. Prior experience with using a mobile phone for health communication (OR 3.6, P=0.014) and those willing to quit smoking (OR 5.1, P=0.043) were likely to perceive a mobile phone smoking cessation intervention as useful. A smartphone application was preferred over text messages, media messages or interactive voice response technology. Content consisting of motivational messages highlighting the methods and benefits of quitting smoking were requested. Conclusion: People who smoke in Indonesia perceived receiving a potential smoking cessation intervention via mobile phones as useful. A multi-component, personalized smartphone application was the desired intervention technique. Such an intervention developed and implemented within a public health program could help address the tobacco epidemic in Indonesia. © 2020 Wibowo MF et al.","Indonesia; MHealth; Mobile phones; Smoking cessation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092728165"

However, scalable strategies to improve uptake of new PMTCT guidelines to reduce new infection rates are needed. This study assessed impact of Mobile Health-Facilitated Behavioral Intervention on the uptake of PMTCT services. Methods: A cluster-randomized trial of a mobile health (mHealth)-supported behavioural training intervention targeting outreach workers (ORWs) was conducted in four districts of Maharashtra, India. Clusters (one Integrated Counselling and Testing Center (ICTC, n = 119), all affiliated ORWs (n = 116) and their assigned HIV-positive pregnant/postpartum clients (n = 1191)) were randomized to standard-of-care (SOC) ORW training vs. the COMmunity home Based INDia (COMBIND) intervention – specialized behavioural training plus a tablet-based mHealth application to support ORW-patient communication and patient engagement in HIV care. Impact on uptake of maternal antiretroviral therapy at delivery, exclusive breastfeeding at six months, infant nevirapine prophylaxis, and early infant diagnosis at six months was assessed using multi-level random-effects logistic regression models. Results: Of 1191 HIV-positive pregnant/postpartum women, 884 were eligible for primary outcome assessment; 487 were randomized to COMBIND. Multivariable analyses identified no statistically significant differences in any primary outcome by study arm. COMBIND was associated with higher uptake of exclusive breastfeeding at two months (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR), 2.10; 95% CI 1.06 to 4.15) and early infant diagnosis at six weeks (aOR, 2.19; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.98) than SOC. Conclusions: The COMBIND intervention was easily integrated into India’s existing PMTCT programme and improved early uptake of two PMTCT components that require self-motivated health-seeking behaviour, thus providing preliminary evidence to support COMBIND as a potentially scalable PMTCT strategy. Further study would identify modifications needed to optimize other PMTCT outcomes. © 2020 The Authors.

Although the presence of melanoma is viewed as a form of cancer, it is challenging to predict it. If melanoma or other skin diseases are identified in the early stages, prognosis can then be successfully achieved to cure them. For this, medical imaging science plays an essential role in detecting such types of skin lesions quickly and accurately. The application of our approaches is to improve skin cancer detection accuracy in medical imaging and further, can be automated using electronic devices such as mobile phones etc. In the proposed paper, an improved strategy to detect three type of skin cancers in early stages are suggested. The considered input is a skin lesion image which by using the proposed method, the system would classify it into cancerous or non-cancerous type of skin. The image segmentation is implemented using fuzzy C-means clustering to separate homogeneous image regions. The preprocessing is done using different filters to enhance the image attributes while the other features are assessed by implementing rgb color-space, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and GLCM methods altogether. Further, for classification, artificial neural network (ANN) is trained using differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Various features are accurately estimated to achieve better results using skin cancer image datasets namely HAM10000 and PH2. The novelty of the work suggests that DE-ANN is best compared among other traditional classifiers in terms of detection accuracy as discussed in result section of this paper. The simulated result shows that the proposed technique effectually detects skin cancer and produces an accuracy of 97.4%. The results are highly accurate compare to other traditional approaches in the same domain. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","DE-ANN; Fuzzy clustering; Image segmentation; Melanoma; Skin Cancer detection","Dermatology; Diagnosis; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy systems; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; mHealth; Neural networks; Oncology; Optimization; Detection accuracy; Differential evolution algorithms; Electronic device; Fuzzy C means clustering; Local binary patterns; Simulated results; Skin lesion images; Traditional approaches; Diseases","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087607157"

One of the possible solutions to the above issue is the use of low-cost pressure sensor integrated with the medicine container whose data can be communicated to the dedicated smartphone Android application. Once the patient taps the medicine out, the pressure sensor sends the data to the smartphone which can be monitored by the patient's family and the sensor can then be discarded. In this work, a simple all paper based pressure sensor to monitor drug dosage is fabricated using Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) grown on paper with an interdigitated electrode drawn using graphite pencil on paper as electrodes. The sensitivity of the fabricated pressure sensor was found to be 0.32 kPa-1 which is comparable and even better than the pressure sensor fabricated using sophisticated techniques. Repeatability of the sensor over 2000 cycles indicates an excellent long-term stability. Bending cycle studies over 1000 cycles observes a negligible change in the performance suggesting the high reliability of the sensor. The fabricated pressure sensor was integrated successfully in the medicine package to monitor the real time pills intake by a patient which shows high promise for its use in health care industry.

In this type-1 patients, effective self-management has been shown to be positively associated with clinical outcomes. However, in adolescent T1D patients, self-management could be difficult because of the natural and evolving age-appropriate attitudes and biological factors. Despite intensive assistance and guidance from their parents is required, studies have shown lack of self-discipline and management resulting in higher haemoglobin A1c.

One of the greatest challenges to tuberculosis control is patient adherence to treatment. Recent research has shown that video-based directly observed therapy is a feasible and effective approach to supporting treatment adherence in high-income settings. However, few studies have explored the potential for such a solution in a low- or middle-income country setting. Globally, these countries' rapidly rising rate of mobile penetration suggests that the potential for translation of these results may be high. Objective: We sought to examine patient perceptions related to the use of mobile health, and specifically video-based directly observed therapy, in a previously unstudied patient demographic: patients with tuberculosis in a low-income country setting (Cambodia). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study in urban and periurban areas in Cambodia, consisting of 6 focus groups with tuberculosis patients who were receiving treatment (standard directly observed therapy) through a nongovernmental organization. Results: Familiarity with mobile technology and apps was widespread in this population, and overall willingness to consider a mobile app for video-based directly observed therapy was high. However, we identified potential challenges. First, patients very much valued their frequent in-person interactions with their health care provider, which may be reduced with the video-based directly observed therapy intervention. Second, there may be technical issues to address, including how to make the app suitable for illiterate participants. Conclusions: While video-based directly observed therapy is a promising technology, even in country settings where mobile penetration is reportedly almost universal, it should be introduced with caution. However, the results were generally promising and yielded important insights that not only will be translated into the further adaptation of key features of video-based directly observed therapy for tuberculosis patients in Cambodia, but also can inform the future design and successful implementation of video-based directly observed therapy interventions in low- and middle-income settings more generally. © Lila Rabinovich, James Steven Molton, Wei Tsang Ooi, Nicholas Iain Paton, Shelly Batra, Joanne Yoong.

The Web became so popular that for many, it is synonymous with the Internet or simply the Net. There were many flavors of the original Web like Web 2.0, Web 3.0, etc. All these versions of Web are different use-cases of the original Web, which is fundamentally Client-Server in nature. A client Web browser (or user-agent) makes a request for a document (or a transaction), and the server services that request – kind of a synchronized request-response service (Pull service). The Next Generation Web (NGW) will have a fundamental paradigm shift – it will be two-ways (full-duplex) asynchronous Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication between two Web browsers using HTML5, Secured WebSocket (wss://), Server Sent Events (SSE), and JavaScript. The Next Generation Web (NGW) will be for human to human, and human to machineries (robots) interaction. Major technologies in Next Generation Web include WebRTC, Web Speech API, and WebUSB. WebRTC is already standardized by W3C and IETF. Web Speech API is at the draft a state. WebUSB is still evolving. NGW is a technology and not a solution – NGW does not need any additional downloads or plugins or any intermediate server. WebRTC supports real-time ultra-low latency audiovisual media and non-media arbitrary data with recording facility. Web Speech API includes speech recognition, speech synthesis, and audio processing on the Web browser. WebUSB will allow USB devices connected to the Web for Collaborative Robotics (Cobotics).

Diagnosis is often delayed. The effectiveness of conventional oral screening has been shown in the Trivandrum oral cancer screening study. The present study will be a step forward to test a mobile phone-based (the mHealth approach) comparing it with the conventional approach. The purpose of this paper is to report the protocol for this study. The primary objective will be to compare both methods in diagnosing oral potentially malignant disorders and cancers. The secondary objective would be to study the cost-effectiveness. Methods and analysis: This will be a cluster-randomized clinical trial of the population in Ernakulam district of Kerala state in India. They will undergo oral cancer screening by community health workers, who will be pre-assigned to the randomly allotted intervention (mHealth) or control (conventional method) clusters. We will enrol a minimum of 9696 subjects from all 6 clusters over 18 months. The cost-effectiveness of the two strategies for oral screening will be determined using data from this randomized controlled trial. The incremental cost per oral cancer/high-risk dysplasia detected, and the incremental cost per life saved will be reported. We will conduct sensitivity and scenario analysis to evaluate the robustness of the findings. Ethics and dissemination: When completed, this will be the first cluster randomized population-based study to test the technology-based approach in India. The knowledge from this study will indicate whether specialists can make a remote diagnosis of oral lesions accurately based on the information gathered using a mobile phone health application and whether the mHealth strategy will be cost-effective in Oral cancer screening. The study will follow the ethical guidelines and will be published in an indexed journal. © 2020 The Author(s)","Cluster randomized study; Head and neck cancer; Mobile-phone-based screening; Oral cancer; Screening","Article; cancer screening; clinical decision making; cost effectiveness analysis; dysplasia; health care cost; high risk population; histology; human; mouth cancer; mouth examination; oral biopsy; priority journal; process design; process optimization; protocol compliance; randomized controlled trial (topic); sample size; sensitivity analysis; workflow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088234891"

With the availability of advanced communication devices, applications and machinery that capture data the society adopted the electronic search process for their daily needs. The data of moving objects, changing values, sequencing events with underlying trajectory nature can provide large information potential if is processed intelligently. The research in trajectory data mining is limited the trajectory datasets with spatiotemporal information only.

The collected data will make a lot of medical diagnosis applications of WBANs, which are obtained directly from the patients’ bodies. Therefore, because of the nature of wireless networks and freely accessible data feature over the public channel, the security and privacy of WBANs is the most critical concern for those who use it for health-care purposes. Accordingly, there is a need for an authentication scheme for letting a trusted user such as doctors or clinical personnel access to the sensor's data from patients.

Controlling the functions of devices include the positioning of the cursor and clicking at the desired position to perform a specific task. All other features like scrolling, double-click, zooming, multiple touches, etc. fall in these categories that can be added to this system on an extension. The positioning of the cursor can be done using object tracking in computer vision. The ability to click can be provided with the help of sensors. Sensors are the good choice as some of them generate voltage signal whenever they experience a change in their respecting sensing medium. Arduino can further detect this voltage signal in order to assist the program for clicking purpose. Such a system can prove very useful in complex medical surgery, defense mission, and can enhance the growing experience of Virtual Reality games if used for entertainment purpose. © 2019 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.

Design: A prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. The protocol is approved and funded by Department of Biotechnology, Government of India on 2 August 2016. Methods: A total of 300 preterm-mother dyads admitted to neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital will be recruited and randomized to intervention and control group. The intervention group would receive mobile health based Preterm Home Care Program and the control group would receive standard preterm care. Intervention group will be followed up at home by community health workers known as Accredited Social Health Activist who will be trained in using the NeoRaksha mobile health application. Preterms outcomes will be assessed during follow-up at hospital. Discussion: Supporting continuity of preterm care is vital as parents and preterms experience transition from Neonatal Intensive Care unit to their home. Empowering mothers and community health workers by integrating mobile technology into health care can help promote healthy preterms, enhance development outcomes and follow-up, which in turn can reduce the mortalities, morbidities, and disabilities associated with prematurity.

The information related to Patient is sent by means of WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network) and sensors to the healthcare database. This has been shown a great potential to transmit vital parameter of the patient at a remote location. Remote monitoring of patient(s), including vital signs, sound and video is to be transmitted, particularly when a patient is in transit. By transmitting the imperative parameters of the patient to a specialist diminishes, the ideal opportunity for starting treatment and permits the emergency crew to be better prepared. This will facilitate a doctor to make a diagnostic conclusion. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop an advance system to transmit the vital parameters of the patient to the smart phone of the doctor at a remote location. After seeing essential parameters of the patient, the specialist can convey/endorse the medication from the remote area. METHODS: To monitor patient’s data in real-time an android application is developed which helps the medical staff to monitor the patient from remote location. All the patient related information is stored in Real Time Clinical Database. RESULTS: The proposed model will allow the doctors to monitor physiological parameters (HR, NIBP, Temp, ECG, SPO2) of the patient, as well as endorse medication from the remote location. This system will be helpful to provide virtual presence of the doctor inside the ambulance and to provide lifesaving drugs to the patient while the patient is in transit. CONCLUSION: The present invention provides a fully integrated system for the doctor to view the vital signs of the patient from the remote location in real-time. © 2019 Naveen Kumar et al.","Computer Controlled Drug Delivery; Remote Drug Delivery; Vital Sign Transmission; WBAN","Controlled drug delivery; Diagnosis; Hybrid systems; Internet of things; Location; mHealth; Physiological models; Smartphones; Targeted drug delivery; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Android applications; Clinical database; Diagnostic conclusion; Physiological parameters; Remote monitoring; Vital sign; WBAN; Wireless body area network; Remote patient monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079895966"

The Anganwadi centres under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) provide a range of health and nutrition services to pregnant women, children <6 years and their mothers. However, major gaps exist in ICDS service delivery. The government is currently strengthening ICDS through an mHealth intervention called Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) installed on smart phones, with accompanying multilevel data dashboards. This system is intended to be a job aid for frontline workers, supervisors and managers, aims to ensure better service delivery and supervision, and enable real-time monitoring and data-based decision-making. However, there is little to no evidence on the effectiveness of such large-scale mHealth interventions integrated with public health programmes in resource-constrained settings on the service delivery and subsequent health and nutrition outcomes. Methods and analysis This study uses a village-matched controlled design with repeated cross-sectional surveys to evaluate whether ICDS-CAS can enable more timely and appropriate services to pregnant women, children <12 months and their mothers, compared with the standard ICDS programme. The study will recruit approximately 1500 Anganwadi workers and 6000+ mother-child dyads from 400+ matched-pair villages in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The primary outcomes are the proportion of beneficiaries receiving (a) adequate number of home visits and (b) appropriate level of counselling by the Anganwadi workers. Secondary outcomes are related to improvements in other ICDS services, and knowledge and practices of the Anganwadi workers and beneficiaries.

We evaluated the effectiveness of a mobilephone- and web-based application, Innovative Mobile-phone Technology for Community Health Operations (ImTeCHO), as a job aid to the government's Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Primary Health Center (PHC) staff to improve coverage of MNCH services in rural tribal communities of Gujarat, India. Methods and findings: This open cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 22 PHCs in six tribal blocks of Bharuch and Narmada districts in India. The ImTeCHO mobile-phone-and web-based application included various technology-based job aids to facilitate scheduling of home visits, screening for complications, counseling during home visits, and supportive supervision by PHC staff. Primary outcome indicators were a composite index calculated based on coverage of important MNCH services and coverage of at least two home visitations by ASHA within the first week of birth. Primary analysis was intention to treat (ITT). Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to account for clustering. Eleven PHCs each were randomly allocated to the intervention (280 ASHAs, population: 234,134) and control (281 ASHAs, population: 242,809) arms. The intervention was implemented from February, 2016 to January, 2017. At the end of the implementation, 6,493 mothers were surveyed. Most of the surveyed women were tribal (5,571, 85.8%), and reported having a government-issued certificate for living below poverty line (4,916, 75.7%). The coverage of at least two home visits within first week of birth was 32.4% in the intervention clusters compared to 22.9% in the control clusters (adjusted effect size 10.2 [95% CI: 6.4, 14.0], p < 0.001). Mean number of home visits within first week of birth was 1.11 and 0.80 for intervention and control clusters, respectively (adjusted effect size 0.34 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.45], p < 0.001). The composite coverage index was 43.0% in the intervention clusters compared to 38.5% (adjusted effect size 4.9 [95% CI: 0.2, 9.5], p = 0.03) in the control clusters. There were substantial improvements in coverage home visits by ASHAs during antenatal period (adjusted effect size 15.7 [95% CI: 11.0, 20.4], p < 0.001), postnatal period (adjusted effect size 6.4, [95% CI: 3.2, 9.6], p <0.001), early initiation of breastfeeding (adjusted effect size 7.8 [95% CI: 4.2, 11.4], p < 0.001), and exclusive breastfeeding (adjusted effect size 13.4 [95% CI: 8.9, 17.9], p < 0.001). Number of infant and neonatal deaths was similar in the two arms in the ITT analysis. The limitations of the study include potential risk of inaccuracies in reporting events that occurred during pregnancy by the mothers and the duration of intervention being 12 months, which might be considered short. Conclusions: In this study, we found that use of ImTeCHO mobile- and web-based application as a job aid by government ASHAs and PHC staff improved coverage and quality of MNCH services in hard-to-reach areas.

Government of India is actively taking initiatives for establishing digital high-speed internet connectivity though National Knowledge Network (NKN), State Wide Application Network (SWAN) National Optical Fiber Network (NOFN) to super-specialist center, medical colleges, research organizations, Primary Health Center (PHC)/ Community Health Center (CHCs) up to block level and panchayat levels. Wellness centers and 'DigiGaon' bring digital inclusion and it enables people in rural areas to be able to access services like telemedicine and skill enhancement with the use of digital technologies. High-speed fiber-optic based internet bandwidth has deployed under NKN in as many as 250 medical colleges around the country. Many medical institutions have migrated to NKN to enhance their capacity of telemedicine activity using telemedicine platform funded by central and state government agencies. Majority of telemedicine in India funded by Ministry of Health Family Welfare (MOHFW) for interlinking Medical Colleges across the country with the purpose of education and National Rural Telemedicine Network (NRTN) for Healthcare delivery under National Health Mission (NHM), National Medical College Network (NMCN) and other public private partnership (PPP) models. Medical super-specialty institutes for the National Resource Centers (NRCs) and Regional Resource Centers (RRCs) for NMCN has defined and medical colleges will soon link to RRCs. India has diversified geographical region with availability of variable bandwidth in different part. Remote PHC/CHCs located outside city has bandwidth issue whereas majority of medical hospitals in the city has high-speed internet bandwidth. Video solutions given by hardware vendors and software vendors needs to be collaborate centrally which enables users to connect even with lower bandwidth or with the use of high-speed broadband (HSB) mobile dongle. It increases the reach to the remotest place in India through any of the available platform (Desktop, H.323 device, Android or IOS smart phone etc). Recording and streaming integration with video collaboration enhances the purpose of sharing the medical educational content during or after e-CME/ workshops/ seminars with remote doctors. Entire collaboration solution thus need direct content sharing, mobility, recording and reporting with support for multiple input sources from cameras, X-Ray, CT-SCAN, fundus camera, ultrasonography etc. Broadcast link needs to share simultaneously to multiple users and connectivity thus follow confidentiality, security and traceability with the usage of video firewall in data center. Traffic routed from outside the institute needs to convert in local IP pool through port address translation called Network Address Translation (NAT) for allowing traffic from known protocols like Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

But this mobile device has limited the resources in terms of battery lifetime, storage, and processing capacity. The new technology known as mobile cloud computing can help users to increase utilization of mobile cloud resources. The limitation of mobile device can be overcome by MCC. The technique called as offloading can transfer the resource-intensive task to remote cloud for processing, and the result will come back to the mobile device. The mobile device connecting to remote cloud with the help of 3G (or) LTE networks causes latency-related issues bandwidth and cost. In order to overcome these problems, MCC has introduced new technology which can reduce latency problems by providing secured and efficient model based on cloudlet. In this paper, we mainly focus on healthcare applications which can be processed by new cloudlet model for reducing processing time as well as providing enough security to user’s data. Initially, the user connects to the available cloudlet; if the cloudlet is not providing required resources or services, the user will redirect to remote cloud. In our model, the cloudlet is used to analyze patient medical records. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Cloud computing; Cloudlet model; Healthcare applications; Mobile cloud computing; Mobile devices","Cloud computing; Digital storage; mHealth; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Battery lifetime; Health care application; Latency problem; Model-based OPC; New technologies; Processing capacities; Processing time; Sending documents; Mobile cloud computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054817778"

According to the WHO, cardiovascular disease is the modern-day disease. However, prognosis rate of cardiac disease patients can be potentially made high with early detection and diagnosis. In this book chapter, we describe automated cardiac health monitoring system using smartphone and wearable sensors. The main contribution of such mobile applications and systems is to form a connected universe with biomedical sensors, patients, physicians, clinics, hospitals, and other medical service providers and to exploit robust analytics to infer and actuate the appropriate information and formative actions. The powerful anomaly analytics exploit AI, signal processing, and deep learning mechanisms that enable predictive decision-making and facilitate preventive cardiac health screening. The main emphasis is to develop and deploy smart, computationally efficient, rather than human-in-loop, user-friendly, data-driven cardiac healthcare solutions, where patients and healthcare service providers are seamlessly connected. In this book chapter, we discuss about important cardiovascular signals, namely, electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), and heart sound or phonocardiogram (PCG), and describe their role in the process of developing a mobile-based cardiac care solution. These cardiac marker signals constitute an intelligent and robust feature space for detection of different cardiac abnormalities and diseases like coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and others. These sensor signals can be captured by affordable wearable sensors. In order to develop such mobile applications and systems, we need to address different challenges like noisy signal removal and data privacy protection along with providing robust analytics engine. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","","Automation; Biosensors; Cardiology; Data privacy; Decision making; Deep learning; Digital devices; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Heart; Internet of things; Medical information systems; mHealth; Mobile computing; Phonocardiography; Signal processing; Smartphones; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiovascular signals; Computationally efficient; Coronary artery disease; Data privacy protections; Detection and diagnosis; Healthcare services; Internet of Things (IOT); Wearable sensors","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084676388"

However, this seldom explains the importance of walking and tracking our health parameters. This paper is an attempt in the development of a prototype of a wearable fitness band with advance pedometer applications. Usually, pedometers are just designed to calculate the number of steps taken by the user or calculate the number of calories burnt. The prototype illustrated in the paper is an extension to the very same. Along with the above mentioned features, it also calculates the walking speed of the user and gives a vibration feedback if the current speed is below a certain threshold level.This system also contains a heart rate monitoring system along with a GPS and Bluetooth module. An Android app was also developed using MIT app inventor. The Bluetooth module is paired with the user's smart phone. If the user experiences a sudden cardiac emergency, an SMS alert and call is made to his relatives with the app. The text message consists the latitude and longitude value where user is present.

This paper reviews the fundamental techniques of blood glucose detection and smart insulin regulation. The most common and widely used technique is the invasive technique that requires users to prick their finger to draw the blood. However, recently a lot of new technologies have been developed for non-invasive technique to monitor the blood glucose level and study in this area is growing rapidly. Among all, the optical and transdermal approach are the two most potential sensing modalities for non-invasive glucose monitoring that choose the very good prospect. The blood glucose level of a human can be measured by passing IR radiation. The glucose concentration in blood depends on the intensity of the wavelength specific to the radiation. The detected blood glucose level is communicated into the smart phone through the wireless channel and the smart phone control the safety critical devices such as insulin infusion pump through IOT based Mobile Medical Applications (MMAs). © 2019 IEEE.","Blood glucose; insulin infusion pump; MMAs; Non- invasive technique; personal-monitoring","Glucose; Insulin; Internet of things; Medical applications; mHealth; Safety engineering; Smartphones; Blood glucose; Insulin infusion pumps; MMAs; Noninvasive technique; Personal monitoring; Blood","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074322200"

They are now becoming an essential part of everyday human life starting from smart watch, smart phone to smart home. The main component of recent technology like the Internet of Things is the wearable devices. Inherently antenna is the essential part for all communicative devices. This paper focuses on antenna design which can be useful for wearable devices. Since they operate in close proximate to the human body, the radiation pattern, frequency of operation and power requirement of the designed antenna must be properly controlled. There are inherently some high frequency hazards of wearable devices which cannot be eliminated and the size of antenna is inversely proportional to frequency. Hence to compensate for these two contradictory requirements fractal designs are introduced, where the antenna can operate at relatively low frequency by essentially increasing the electrical length due to fractal structure. This paper presents the performance analysis or comparison of different iterations of antenna when fractal designs are introduced. The antenna operates around 5.8 GHz, which is a recommended frequency band for wearable devices by Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A high return loss is achieved which in turn indicates a measure of forward power propagation. The antenna is fabricated with FR4 substrate. © 2019 IEEE.","Gain; Return loss; Self similar; Smart device; Specific absorption rate (SAR); Wearable antenna","Automation; Directional patterns (antenna); Fractals; mHealth; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Smartphones; Gain; Return loss; Self-similar; Smart devices; Specific absorption rate; Wearable antennas","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074127962"

This includes both nutritional anemias, of which iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the commonest and inherited hemolytic anemias like β thalassemias (β-TT). In Eastern and North-Eastern India about 25–40% of the public blood bank blood is consumed by patients with β Thalassemia. Moreover, 51% of Indian women in the reproductive age suffer from IDA. Most vulnerable group of anemic patients is in the rural underserved regions. This underserved population can only be served through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), automation, supported by telemedicine. To combat the problems of both IDA and β-thalassemia by early diagnosis at the point-of-care– we have developed Suśruta - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven robust smartphone-based health care application. This App uses five major components of AI; namely: (1) Natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the unstructured clinical data and translate it into computer understandable 3rd Generation SNOMED and ICD10 ontologies; (2) Speech Synthesis; (3) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ML/DL) on 60,283 labelled common blood counts (CBC) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) data collected over 8 years by a teaching hospital in Kolkata for β-TT screening; (4) Computer Vision and Image Processing techniques to interpret hemoglobin content in blood through non-invasive analysis of conjunctiva and nailbed images; and (5) NoSQL and Big-data Graph database-driven Bayesian Knowledge Network for Evidence Based Medicine and Bayesian Outcome Tracing for Predictive Medicine. Unlike previous systems, the ML/DL technique of β-Thalassemia carrier screening with CBC improved the accuracy of screening by two folds compared similar approaches analyzing CBC with Mentzer Index. Moreover, the uniqueness of Suśruta is that the App is robust and works both in an offline and online mode at resource constrained point-of-care. This is the first time AI is used for comprehensive anemia care by early diagnosis, which empowers the ordinary health workers in rural underserved communities. Furthermore, it will introduce the concept of patient empowerment and person centered care by changing the definition of point-of-care in rural India. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","AI; Anemia; ANN; Artificial Intelligence; Bayesian Knowledge Network; Bayesian Outcome Tracing; Big data; CDSS; Healthcare; ML/DL; NoSQL; Smartphone apps; Thalassemia","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Blood; Deep learning; E-learning; Health care; High performance liquid chromatography; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Machine components; Medical education; mHealth; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Rural areas; Smartphones; Speech synthesis; Anemia; Bayesian; CDSS; Knowledge networks; ML/DL; NoSQL; Smartphone apps; Thalassemia; Diagnosis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077501967"

However, it is necessary to assess end-user perceptions regarding mobile health interventions prior to its implementation. This would throw light on the acceptability of mobile phone communication in bringing about behavioural changes among the target Indonesian population. The aim of this study was to explore the perceived usefulness of receiving a potential smoking cessation intervention via mobile phones. Methods: This is an exploratory cross-sectional study involving current and former adult tobacco smokers residing in Indonesia. Online advertisement and snowballing were used to recruit respondents. Data was collected using a web-based survey over a period of 4 weeks. Those willing to participate signed an online consent and were subsequently directed to the online questionnaire that obtained demographics, tobacco usage patterns, perceived usefulness of a mobile phone smoking cessation application and its design. Results: A total of 161 people who smoked tobacco responded to the online survey. The mean age of the participants was 29.4. Of the 123 respondents, 102 were men. Prior experience with using a mobile phone for health communication (OR 3.6, P=0.014) and those willing to quit smoking (OR 5.1, P=0.043) were likely to perceive a mobile phone smoking cessation intervention as useful. A smartphone application was preferred over text messages, media messages or interactive voice response technology. Content comprising of motivational messages highlighting the methods and benefits of quitting smoking were requested. Conclusion: People who smoke in Indonesia perceived receiving a potential smoking cessation intervention via mobile phones as useful. A multi-component, personalized smartphone application was the desired intervention technique. Such an intervention developed and implemented within a public health program could help address the tobacco epidemic in Indonesia. © 2019 Wibowo MF et al.","Indonesia; MHealth; Mobile phones; Smoking cessation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078360904"
